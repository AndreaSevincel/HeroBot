the Determination of
Molecular Dimensions

Technische Hochschule, Zurich, 1905 (Courtesy of ETH)

Einstein submitted a dissertation to the University of Zurich
in 1901, about a year after graduation from the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), but withdrew it
early in 1902 In a successful second attempt three years
later, he combined the techniques of classical hydrodynamics with those of the theory of diffusion to create a new
method for the determination of molecular sizes and of
Avogadro’s number, a method he applied to solute sugar
molecules The dissertation was completed on 30 April 1905
and submitted to the University of Zurich on 20 July On
19 August 1905, shortly after the thesis was accepted, the
Annalen der Physik received a slightly different version for
publication
By 1905, several methods for the experimental determination of molecular dimensions were available Although
estimates of upper bounds for the sizes of microscopic constituents of matter had been discussed for a long time, the
first reliable methods for determining molecular sizes were
developed in the second half of the nineteenth century,
based on the kinetic theory of gases The study of phenomena as diverse as contact electricity in metals, the dispersion
of light, and black-body radiation yielded new approaches to
the problem of molecular dimensions Most of the methods
available by the turn of the century gave values for the size
of molecules and for Avogadro’s number that are in more or
less satisfactory agreement with each other
Although Einstein claimed that the method in his dissertation is the first to use phenomena in fluids in the determination of molecular dimensions, the behavior of liquids
plays a role in various earlier methods For example, the
31

PART ONE

comparison of densities in the liquid and gaseous states is
an important part of Loschmidt’s method, based on the kinetic theory of gases A method that depends entirely on the
physics of liquids was developed as early as 1816 by Thomas
Young Young’s study of surface tension in liquids led to an
estimate of the range of molecular forces, and capillary phenomena were used later in several different ways to determine molecular sizes
A kinetic theory of liquids, comparable to the kinetic theory of gases, was not available, and the methods for deriving molecular volumes exclusively from the properties of
liquids did not give very precise results Einstein’s method,
on the other hand, yields values comparable in precision to
those provided by the kinetic theory of gases While methods based on capillarity presuppose the existence of molecular forces, Einstein’s central assumption is the validity of
using classical hydrodynamics to calculate the effect of solute molecules, treated as rigid spheres, on the viscosity of
the solvent in a dilute solution
Einstein’s method is well suited to determine the size of
solute molecules that are large compared to those of the solvent In 1905 William Sutherland published a new method
for determining the masses of large molecules that shares
important elements with Einstein’s Both methods make use
of the molecular theory of diffusion that Nernst developed
on the basis of van’t Hoff’s analogy between solutions and
gases, and of Stokes’s law of hydrodynamical friction
Sutherland was interested in the masses of large molecules
because of the role they play in the chemical analysis of
organic substances such as albumin In developing a new
method for the determination of molecular dimensions, Einstein was concerned with several other problems on differ32

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

ent levels of generality An outstanding current problem of
the theory of solutions was whether molecules of the solvent
are attached to the molecules or ions of the solute Einstein’s
dissertation contributed to the solution of this problem He
recalled in a letter to Jean Perrin in November 1909: “At
the time I used the viscosity of the solution to determine
the volume of sugar dissolved in water because in this way I
hoped to take into account the volume of any attached water
molecules” The results obtained in his dissertation indicate
that such an attachment does occur
Einstein’s concerns extended beyond this particular question to more general problems of the foundations of the
theory of radiation and the existence of atoms He later emphasized in the same letter: “A precise determination of the
size of molecules seems to me of the highest importance
because Planck’s radiation formula can be tested more precisely through such a determination than through measurements on radiation”
The dissertation also marked the first major success in
Einstein’s effort to find further evidence for the atomic hypothesis, an effort that culminated in his explanation of
Brownian motion By the end of 1905 he had published
three independent methods for determining molecular dimensions, and in the following years he found several more
Of all these methods, the one in his dissertation is most
closely related to his earlier studies of physical phenomena
in liquids
Einstein’s efforts to obtain a doctoral degree illuminate
some of the institutional constraints on the development
of his work on the problem of molecular dimensions His
choice of a theoretical topic for a dissertation at the Univer33

PART ONE

sity of Zurich was quite unusual, both because it was theoretical and because a dissertation theme was customarily
assigned by the supervising professor By 1900, theoretical
physics was slowly beginning to achieve recognition as an
independent discipline in German-speaking countries, but it
was not yet established at either the ETH or the University
of Zurich A beginning had been made at the ETH soon
after its founding, with the appointment of a German mathematical physicist, Rudolf Clausius His departure a decade
later may have been hastened by lack of official sympathy for
a too-theoretical approach to the training of engineers and
secondary-school teachers, the primary task of the school
Clausius’s successor—after the position had been vacant
for a number of years—was H F Weber, who occupied the
chair for Mathematical and Technical Physics from 1875 until his death in 1912 During the last two decades of the
nineteenth century, he did original research, mainly in experimental physics and electrotechnology, including work on
a number of topics that were important for Einstein’s later
research, such as black-body radiation, the anomalous lowtemperature behavior of specific heats, and the theory of
diffusion; but his primary interests were never those of a theoretical physicist The situation of theoretical physics at the
University of Zurich at the turn of the century was hardly
better Four other major Swiss universities either had two
full professorships in physics or one full and one nontenured
position, while Zurich had only one physics chair, held by the
experimentalist Alfred Kleiner
Since the ETH was not authorized to grant doctoral degrees until 1909, a special arrangement enabled ETH students to obtain doctorates from the University of Zurich
Most dissertations in physics by ETH students were pre34

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

pared under Weber’s supervision, with Kleiner as the second referee As noted above, almost all physics dissertations
prepared at the ETH and the University of Zurich between
1901 and 1905 were on experimental topics suggested to the
students by their supervisor or at least closely related to the
latter’s research interests The range of topics was quite limited, and generally not at the forefront of experimental research Thermal and electrical conductivity, and instruments
for their measurement, were by far the most prominent subjects General questions of theoretical physics, such as the
properties of the ether or the kinetic theory of gases, occasionally found their way into examination papers, but they
were hardly touched upon in dissertations
In the winter semester of 1900–1901, Einstein intended to
work for a degree under Weber The topic may have been
related to thermoelectricity, a field in which Einstein had
shown an interest and in which several of Weber’s doctoral
students did experimental research After a falling-out with
Weber, Einstein turned to Kleiner for advice and comments
on his work
Although Kleiner’s research at this time focused on measuring instruments, he did have an interest in foundational
questions of physics, and Einstein’s discussions with him covered a wide range of topics Einstein showed his first dissertation to Kleiner before submitting it to the university in
November 1901 This dissertation has not survived, and the
evidence concerning its contents is somewhat ambiguous In
April 1901 Einstein wrote that he planned to summarize his
work on molecular forces, up to that time mainly on liquids;
at the end of the year, his future wife Mileva Marić stated
that he had submitted a work on molecular forces in gases
Einstein himself wrote that it concerned “a topic in the
35

PART ONE

kinetic theory of gases” There are indications that the dissertation may have discussed Boltzmann’s work on gas theory,
as well as Drude’s work on the electron theory of metals
By February 1902 Einstein had withdrawn the dissertation, possibly at Kleiner’s suggestion that he avoid a controversy with Boltzmann In view of the predominantly experimental character of the physics dissertations submitted to
the University of Zurich at the time, lack of experimental
confirmation for his theoretical results may have played a
role in the decision to withdraw the thesis In January 1903
Einstein still expressed interest in molecular forces, but he
stated in a letter to Michele Besso that he was giving up his
plan to obtain a doctorate, arguing that it would be of little help to him, and that “the whole comedy has become
tiresome for me”
Little is known about when Einstein started to work on
the dissertation he completed in 1905 By March 1903 some
of the central ideas of the 1905 dissertation had already occurred to him Kleiner, one of the two faculty reviewers of
his dissertation, acknowledged in his review that Einstein
had chosen the topic himself and pointed out that “the arguments and calculations to be carried out are among the most
difficult in hydrodynamics” The other reviewer, Heinrich
Burkhardt, Professor of Mathematics at the University of
Zurich, added: “The mode of treatment demonstrates fundamental mastery of the relevant mathematical methods”
Although Burkhardt checked Einstein’s calculations, he
overlooked a significant error in them The only reported
criticism of Einstein’s dissertation was for being too short
Einstein’s biographer Carl Seelig reports: “Einstein later
laughingly recounted that his dissertation was at first returned to him by Kleiner with the comment that it was too
36

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

short After he had added a single sentence, it was accepted
without further comment”
Compared to the other topics of his research at the time,
his hydrodynamical method for determining molecular dimensions was a dissertation topic uniquely suited to the empirically oriented Zurich academic environment In contrast
to the Brownian-motion work, for which the experimental
techniques needed to extract information from observations
were not yet available, Einstein’s hydrodynamical method
for determining the dimensions of solute molecules enabled
him to derive new empirical results from data in standard
tables
Like Loschmidt’s method based on the kinetic theory of
gases, Einstein’s method depends on two equations for two
unknowns, Avogadro’s number N and the molecular radius
P  The first of Einstein’s equations (see third equation on
p 64) follows from a relation between the coefficients of
viscosity of a liquid with and without suspended molecules
(k∗ and k, respectively),
k∗ = k1 + ϕ

(1)

where ϕ is the fraction of the volume occupied by the solute
molecules This equation, in turn, is derived from a study of
the dissipation of energy in the fluid
Einstein’s other fundamental equation follows from an expression for the coefficient of diffusion D of the solute This
expression is obtained from Stokes’s law for a sphere of radius P moving in a liquid, and van’t Hoff’s law for the osmotic pressure:
D = RT · 1 
6πk NP
37

(2)

PART ONE

where R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature,
and N Avogadro’s number
The derivation of eq (1), technically the most complicated part of Einstein’s thesis, presupposes that the motion
of the fluid can be described by the hydrodynamical equations for stationary flow of an incompressible homogeneous
liquid, even in the presence of solute molecules; that the
inertia of these molecules can be neglected; that they do
not affect each other’s motions; and that they can be treated
as rigid spheres moving in the fluid without slipping, under
the sole influence of hydrodynamical stresses The hydrodynamic techniques needed are derived from Kirchhoff’s Vorlesungen über mathematische Physik, volume 1, Mechanik
(1897), a book that Einstein first read during his student
years
Eq (2) follows from the conditions for the dynamical and
thermodynamical equilibrium of the fluid Its derivation requires the identification of the force on a single molecule,
which appears in Stokes’s law, with the apparent force due
to the osmotic pressure The key to handling this problem is
the introduction of fictitious countervailing forces Einstein
had earlier introduced such fictitious forces to counteract
thermodynamical effects in proving the applicability to diffusion phenomena of a generalized form of the second law
of thermodynamics, and in his papers on statistical physics
Einstein’s derivation of eq (2) does not involve the theoretical tools he developed in his work on the statistical foundations of thermodynamics; he reserved a more elaborate
derivation, using these methods, for his first paper on Brownian motion Eq (2) was derived independently, in somewhat more general form, by Sutherland in 1905 To deal
with the available empirical data, Sutherland had to allow
38

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

for a varying coefficient of sliding friction between the diffusing molecule and the solution
The basic elements of Einstein’s method—the use of diffusion theory and the application of hydrodynamical techniques to phenomena involving the atomistic constitution of
matter or electricity—can be traced back to his earlier work
Einstein’s previous work had touched upon most aspects of
the physics of liquids in which their molecular structure is
assumed to play a role, such as Laplace’s theory of capillarity, Van der Waals’s theory of liquids, and Nernst’s theory of
diffusion and electrolytic conduction
Before Einstein’s dissertation, the application of hydrodynamics to phenomena involving the atomic constitution of
matter or electricity was restricted to consideration of the
effects of hydrodynamical friction on the motion of ions
Stokes’s law was employed in methods for the determination of the elementary charge and played a role in studies
of electrolytic conduction Einstein’s interest in the theory
of electrolytic conduction may have been decisive for the
development of some of the main ideas in his dissertation
This interest may have suggested a study of molecular aggregates in combination with water, as well as some of the
techniques used in the dissertation
In 1903 Einstein and Besso discussed a theory of dissociation that required the assumption of such aggregates, the
“hypothesis of ionic hydrates,” as Besso called it, claiming
that this assumption resolves difficulties with Ostwald’s law
of dilution The assumption also opens the way to a simple
calculation of the sizes of ions in solution, based on hydrodynamical considerations In 1902 Sutherland had considered
a calculation of the sizes of ions on the basis of Stokes’s formula, but rejected it as in disagreement with experimental
39

PART ONE

data Sutherland did not use the assumption of ionic hydrates, which can avoid such disagreement by permitting
ionic sizes to vary with such physical conditions as temperature and concentration The idea of determining the sizes of
ions by means of classical hydrodynamics occurred to Einstein in March 1903, when he proposed in a letter to Besso
what appears to be just the calculation that Sutherland had
rejected:
Have you already calculated the absolute magnitude of ions
on the assumption that they are spheres and so large that
the hydrodynamical equations for viscous fluids are applicable? With our knowledge of the absolute magnitude of the
electron [charge] this would be a simple matter indeed I
would have done it myself but lack the reference material
and the time; you could also bring in diffusion in order to
obtain information about neutral salt molecules in solution

This passage is remarkable, because both key elements of
Einstein’s method for the determination of molecular dimensions, the theories of hydrodynamics and diffusion, are
already mentioned, although the reference to hydrodynamics probably covers only Stokes’s law While a program very
similar to the first of Einstein’s proposals to Besso was being
pursued at the time by William Robert Bousfield, Einstein’s
dissertation can be seen to be an elaboration of the second proposal, regarding diffusion and neutral salt molecules
Einstein may thus have been proceeding similarly to Nernst,
who first developed his theory of diffusion for the simpler
case of nonelectrolytes The study of sugar solutions could
draw upon extensive and relatively precise numerical data
on viscosity and the diffusion coefficient, avoiding problems
of dissociation and electrical interactions
40

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

The results obtained with Einstein’s method for the determination of molecular dimensions differed from those obtained by other methods at the time, even when new data
taken from Landolt and Bornstein’s physical-chemical tables
were used to recalculate them In his papers on Brownian motion, Einstein cited either the value he obtained for
Avogadro’s number, or a more standard one Only once, in
1908, did he comment on the uncertainty in the determination of this number By 1909 Perrin’s careful measurements
of Brownian motion produced a new value for Avogadro’s
number, significantly different from the values Einstein obtained from his hydrodynamical method and from Planck’s
black-body radiation law For Einstein, this discrepancy was
particularly significant in view of what he regarded as the
problematic nature of Planck’s derivation of the radiation
law
In 1909 Einstein drew Perrin’s attention to his hydrodynamical method for determining the size of solute molecules He emphasized that this method allows one to take
into account the volume of any water molecules attached
to the solute molecules, and suggested its application to
the suspensions studied by Perrin In the following year, an
experimental study of Einstein’s formula for the viscosity
coefficients (eq [1] above) was performed in Perrin’s laboratory by Jacques Bancelin Bancelin studied uniform aqueous
emulsions of gamboge, prepared with the help of Perrin’s
method of fractional centrifugation Bancelin confirmed that
the increase in viscosity does not depend on the size of the
suspended particles, but only on the fraction of the total
volume that they occupy However, he found a value for the
increased viscosity that differs significantly from Einstein’s
prediction Bancelin sent a report of his experiments to
41

PART ONE

Einstein, apparently citing a value of 39 for the coefficient
of ϕ in eq (1), instead of the predicted value of l
After an unsuccessful attempt to find an error in his calculations, Einstein wrote to his student and collaborator Ludwig Hopf in January 1911: “I have checked my previous calculations and arguments and found no error in them You
would be doing a great service in this matter if you would
carefully recheck my investigation Either there is an error
in the work, or the volume of Perrin’s suspended substance
in the suspended state is greater than Perrin believes”
Hopf found an error in the derivatives of the velocity
components, which occur in the equations for the pressure
components in Einstein’s dissertation (see pp 53–54 below)
After correction of this error, the coefficient of ϕ in eq (1)
becomes 25
By mid-January 1911 Einstein had informed Bancelin and
Perrin of Hopf’s discovery of the error in his calculations
The remaining discrepancy between the corrected factor 25
in eq (1) and Bancelin’s experimental value of 39 led Einstein to suspect that there might also be an experimental
error He asked Perrin: “Wouldn’t it be possible that your
mastic particles, like colloids, are in a swollen state? The influence of such a swelling 39/25 would be of rather slight
influence on Brownian motion, so that it might possibly have
escaped you”
On 21 January 1911, Einstein submitted his correction
for publication In the Annalen der Physik he presented the
corrected form of some of the equations in the dissertation
and recalculated Avogadro’s number He obtained a value
of 656 × 1023 per mole, a value that is close to those derived from kinetic theory and Planck’s black-body radiation
formula
42

EINSTEIN’S DISSERTATION

Bancelin continued his experiments, with results that
brought experiment and theory into closer agreement Four
months later, he presented a paper on his viscosity measurements to the French Academy of Sciences, giving a value
of 29 as the coefficient of ϕ in eq (1) Bancelin also recalculated Avogadro’s number by extrapolating his results for
emulsions to sugar solutions, and found a value of 70 × 1023
per mole
Einstein’s dissertation was at first overshadowed by his
more spectacular work on Brownian motion, and it required
an initiative by Einstein to bring it to the attention of his
fellow scientists But the wide variety of applications of its
results ultimately made the dissertation one of his most frequently cited papers

A New Determination of
Molecular Dimensions

(PhD Dissertation, University of Zurich)
The earliest determinations of the real sizes of molecules
were made possible by the kinetic theory of gases, but thus
far the physical phenomena observed in liquids have not
helped in ascertaining molecular sizes No doubt this is because it has not yet been possible to surmount the hurdles
that impede the development of a detailed molecular-kinetic
theory of liquids It will be shown in this paper that the size
of molecules of substances dissolved in an undissociated dilute solution can be determined from the internal viscosity
of the solution and of the pure solvent, and from the diffusion rate of the solute within the solvent provided that the
volume of a solute molecule is large compared to the volume of a solvent molecule This is possible because, with
respect to its mobility within the solvent and its effect on
the viscosity of the latter, such a molecule will behave approximately like a solid body suspended in a solvent Thus,
in the immediate vicinity of a molecule, one can apply the
equations of hydrodynamics to the motion of the solvent in
45

PAPER 1

which the liquid is treated as homogeneous and hence its
molecular structure need not be taken into consideration
We will choose a sphere as the solid body that shall represent the solute molecules

1 How a Very Small Sphere Suspended in a
Liquid Influences Its Motion
Let us base our discussion on an incompressible homogeneous liquid with a coefficient of viscosity k, whose velocity
components u, v, w are given as functions of the coordinates x, y, z and of time At an arbitrary point x0 , y0 , z0 ,
let us think of the functions u, v, w as functions of x − x0 ,
y − y0 , z − z0 expanded in a Taylor’s series, and of a region G
around this point so small that within it only the linear terms
of this expansion need be considered As is well known, the
motion of the liquid within G can then be regarded as a
superposition of three motions:
1 A parallel displacement of all particles of the liquid without
a change in their relative positions;
2 A rotation of the liquid without a change in the relative
positions of the particles of the liquid;
3 A dilational motion in three mutually perpendicular directions (the principal axes of dilation)

Let us now assume that in region G there is a spherical
rigid body whose center lies at the point x0 , y0 , z0 and whose
dimensions are very small compared with those of region G
We further assume that the motion is so slow that the kinetic
energy of the sphere as well as that of the liquid can be neglected We also assume that the velocity components of a
46

DETERMINATION OF MOLECULAR DIMENSIONS

surface element of the sphere coincide with the corresponding velocity components of the adjacent liquid particles, ie,
that the contact layer (imagined to be continuous) also displays a coefficient of viscosity that is not infinitesimally small
It is obvious that the sphere simply takes part in the partial
motions 1 and 2 without altering the motion of neighboring
particles, since the liquid moves like a rigid body in these
partial motions and since we have neglected the effects of
inertia
However, motion 3 does get altered by the presence of
the sphere, and our next task will be to investigate the effect of the sphere on this motion of the liquid If we refer
motion 3 to a coordinate system whose axes are parallel to
the principal axes of dilation and set
x − x0 = ξ
y − y0 = η
z − z0 = ζ

we can describe the above motion, if the sphere is not
present, by the equations


 u0 = Aξ
v0 = Bη

 w = Cζ
0

(1)

A, B, C are constants that, because the liquid is incompressible, satisfy the condition
A + B + C = 0

(2)

If, now, a rigid sphere of radius P is introduced at the point
x0 , y0 , z0 , the motion of the liquid around it will change
We will, for convenience, call P “finite,” but all the values of
47

PAPER 1

ξ, η, ζ, for which the liquid motion is no longer noticeably
altered by the sphere, we will call “infinitely large”
Because of the symmetry of the motion of the liquid being
considered, it is clear that during this motion the sphere can
perform neither a translation nor a rotation, and we obtain
the boundary conditions
u = v = w = 0 when ρ = P 

where
ρ=

Here u, v, w denote the velocity components of this motion
(changed by the sphere) If we set
u = Aξ + u1 
v = Bη + v1 
w = Cζ + w1 

(3)

the velocities u1 , v1 , w1 would have to vanish at infinity, since
at infinity the motion represented in equations (3) should
reduce to that represented by equations (1)
The functions u, v, w have to satisfy the equations of hydrodynamics, including viscosity and neglecting inertia Thus

equations (5) satisfy equations (4) as well as the boundary
conditions of the problem
It can also be demonstrated that equations (5) are the
only solution of equations (4) that is compatible with the
boundary conditions of our problem The proof will only be
outlined here Assume that in a finite region the velocity
components u, v, w of a liquid satisfy equations (4) If there
existed yet another solution U , V , W for equations (4) in
51

PAPER 1

which U = u, V = v, W = w at the boundaries of the region
in question, then U − u, V − v, W − w would be a solution
for equations (4) in which the velocity components vanish at
the boundary Thus no mechanical work is supplied to the
liquid in the region in question Since we have neglected the
kinetic energy of the liquid, it follows that in this volume
the work converted to heat is also zero This leads to the
conclusion that in the entire space we must have u = u1 ,
v = v1 , w = w1 if the region is at least partly bounded by
stationary walls8 By passing to the limit, this result can also
be extended to a case where the region is infinite, as in the
case considered above One can thus show that the solution
found above is the only solution to the problem
We now draw a sphere of radius R around point x0 , y0 ,
z0 , with R infinitely large compared to P , and calculate the
energy (per unit time) that is converted to heat in the liquid
inside the sphere This energy W is equal to the mechanical
work done on the liquid If Xn , Yn , Zn denote the components of the pressure exerted on the surface of the sphere
of radius R, we have

of the sphere decreases the energy dissipated by 2δ2 k It
is noteworthy that the effect of the suspended sphere on the
quantity of energy dissipated is exactly the same as it would
be if the presence of the sphere did not affect the motion
of the liquid around it at all20

2 Calculation of the Coefficient of Viscosity
of a Liquid in Which Very Many
Irregularly Distributed Small Spheres
Are Suspended
In the previous section we considered the case where, in
a region G of the order of magnitude defined earlier, a
sphere is suspended that is very small compared with the
region, and we investigated how this sphere affects the motion of the liquid We are now going to assume that region
G contains innumerably many randomly distributed spheres
of equal radius, and that this radius is so small that the combined volume of all of the spheres is very small compared
to the region G Let the number of spheres per unit volume be n, where, up to negligibly small terms, n is constant
throughout the liquid
Again, we begin with the motion of a homogeneous liquid
without any suspended spheres and consider again the most
general dilational motion If no spheres are present, an appropriate choice of the coordinate system will permit us to
55

PAPER 1

represent the velocity components u0 , v0 , w0 at an arbitrary
point x, y, z of G by the equations
u0 = Ax
v0 = By
w0 = Cz

where
A + B + C = 0

A sphere suspended at point xν , yν , zν will affect this motion in a way that is evident from equation (6)21 Since
we are choosing the average distance between neighboring
spheres to be large compared to their radius, and consequently the additional velocity components arising from all
the suspended spheres are very small compared to u0 , v0 ,
w0 , we obtain for the velocity components u, v, w in the
liquid, after taking into account the suspended spheres and
neglecting terms of higher orders,

xν , yν , zν are the coordinates of the centers of the spheres
Furthermore, from equations (7) and (7a) we conclude that,
up to infinitesimally small quantities of higher order, the
presence of each sphere results in a decrease of heat production by 2δ2 k per unit time22 and that the energy converted to heat in region G has the value
W = 2δ2 k − 2nδ2 k

per unit volume, or
W = 2δ2 k1 − ϕ

(7b)

where ϕ denotes the fraction of the volume that is occupied
by the spheres
Equation (7b) gives the impression that the coefficient of
viscosity of the inhomogeneous mixture of liquid and suspended spheres (in the following called “mixture” for short)
is smaller than the coefficient of viscosity k of the liquid23
However, this is not so, since A, B, C are not the values
of the principal dilations of the liquid flow represented by
equations (8); we will call the principal dilations of the mixture A∗ , B∗ , C∗  For reasons of symmetry, it follows that the
directions of the principal dilations of the mixture are parallel to the directions of the principal dilations A, B, C, ie,

Thus we obtain the following result:
If very small rigid spheres are suspended in a liquid, the
coefficient of viscosity increases by a fraction that is equal to
the total volume of the spheres suspended in a unit volume,
provided that this total volume is very small29

3 On the Volume of a Dissolved Substance
Whose Molecular Volume Is Large
Compared to That of the Solvent
Consider a dilute solution of a substance that does not dissociate in the solution Let a molecule of the dissolved substance be large compared to a molecule of the solvent and
be considered as a rigid sphere of radius P  We can then
apply the result obtained in section 2 If k∗ denotes the coefficient of viscosity of the solution and k that of the pure
solvent, we have
k∗ = 1 + ϕ
k

where ϕ is the total volume of the molecules per unit volume
of the solution30
We wish to calculate ϕ for a 1% aqueous solution of
sugar According to Burkhard’s observations (Landolt and
Börnstein’s Tables), k∗ /k = 10245 (at 20◦ C) for a 1% aqueous sugar solution, hence ϕ = 00245 for (almost exactly)
001 g of sugar Thus, one gram of sugar dissolved in water
has the same effect on the coefficient of viscosity as do small
suspended rigid spheres of a total volume of 245 cm3 31
This consideration neglects the effect exerted on the viscosity of the solvent by the osmotic pressure resulting from the
dissolved sugar
Let us remember that 1 g of solid sugar has a volume
of 061 cm3  This same volume is also found for the specific volume s of sugar in solution if one considers the sugar
solution as a mixture of water and sugar in dissolved form
Ie, the density of a 1% aqueous sugar solution (relative to
water of the same temperature) at 175◦ is 100388 Hence
we have (neglecting the difference between the density of
60

DETERMINATION OF MOLECULAR DIMENSIONS

water at 4◦ and at 175◦ 
1
= 099 + 001 s
100388

and thus
s = 061

Thus, while the sugar solution behaves like a mixture of
water and solid sugar with respect to its density, the effect on
viscosity is four times larger than what would result from the
suspension of the same amount of sugar32 It seems to me
that, from the point of view of molecular theory, this result
can only be interpreted by assuming that a sugar molecule in
solution impedes the mobility of the water in its immediate
vicinity, so that an amount of water whose volume is about
three times larger than the volume of the sugar molecule is
attached to the sugar molecule33
Hence we may say that a dissolved molecule of sugar
(ie, the molecule together with the water attached to it)
behaves hydrodynamically like a sphere with a volume of
245 · 342/N cm3 , where 342 is the molecular weight of
sugar and N is the number of actual molecules in one grammolecule34

4 On the Diffusion of an Undissociated
Substance in a Liquid Solution
Let us consider a solution of the kind discussed in section 3
If a force K acts upon a molecule, which we assume to be a
sphere with radius P , the molecule will move with a velocity
ω, which is determined by P and the coefficient of viscosity
61

PAPER 1

k of the solvent Indeed, the following equation holds:3
ω=

K 
6πkP

(1)

We use this relation to calculate the coefficient of diffusion of an undissociated solution If p is the osmotic pressure of the dissolved substance, the only motion-producing
force in such a dilute solution, then the force acting on the
dissolved substance per unit volume of solution in the direction of the X-axis equals −δp/δx If there are ρ grams
per unit volume, and m is the molecular weight of the dissolved substance and N the number of actual molecules
in one gram-molecule, then ρ/m · N is the number of
(actual) molecules per unit volume, and the force exerted
on a molecule by virtue of the concentration gradient is
δp

K=− m
ρN δx

(2)

If the solution is sufficiently dilute, the osmotic pressure is
given by the equation:
p = R ρT 

(3)

where T is the absolute temperature and R = 831 · 107 
From equations (1), (2), and (3) we obtain for the migration

Finally, the amount of the substance passing per unit time
through a unit cross section in the direction of the X-axis is
δρ

ωρ = − RT · 1
6πk NP δx

Hence, we obtain for the coefficient of diffusion D
D = RT · 1 35
6nk NP

Thus, from the coefficients of diffusion and viscosity of the
solvent we can calculate the product of the number N of actual molecules in one gram-molecule and the hydrodynamically effective molecular radius P 
In this derivation the osmotic pressure has been treated as
a force acting on the individual molecules, which obviously
does not agree with the viewpoint of the kinetic molecular
theory; since in our case—according to the latter—the osmotic pressure must be conceived as only an apparent force
However, this difficulty disappears when one considers that
the (apparent) osmotic forces that correspond to the concentration gradients in the solution may be kept in (dynamic)
equilibrium by means of numerically equal forces acting on
the individual molecules in the opposite direction, which can
easily be seen by thermodynamic methods
δp
The osmotic force acting on a unit mass − ρ1 δx can be
counterbalanced by the force −Px (exerted on the individual
dissolved molecules) if
δp
− Px = 0
−1
ρ δx

Thus, if one imagines that (per unit mass) the dissolved
substance is acted upon by two sets of forces Px and −Px
that mutually cancel out each other, then −Px counterbalances the osmotic pressure, leaving only the force Px , which
63

PAPER 1

is numerically equal to the osmotic pressure, as the cause
of motion The difficulty mentioned above has thus been
eliminated4

where n is the number of dissolved molecules per unit volume and P is the hydrodynamically effective radius of the

On the other hand, we found in section 4 that
NP = RT 1 
6πk D

These two equations enable us to calculate separately the
quantities P and N , of which N must be independent of
the nature of the solvent, the dissolved substance, and the
temperature, if our theory agrees with the facts

DETERMINATION OF MOLECULAR DIMENSIONS

We will carry out the calculation for an aqueous solution
of sugar From the data on the viscosity of the sugar solution
cited earlier, it follows that at 20◦ C,
NP 3 = 20038

According to the experiments of Graham (as calculated by
Stefan), the diffusion coefficient of sugar in water is 0384 at
95◦ C, if the day is chosen as the unit of time The viscosity
of water at 95◦ is 00135 We will insert these data in our
formula for the diffusion coefficient, even though they have
been obtained using 10% solutions, and strict validity of our
formula cannot be expected at such high concentrations We
obtain
NP = 208 · 1016 

Neglecting the differences between the values of P at 95◦
and 20◦ , the values found for NP 3 and NP yield
P = 99 · 10−8 cm

Einstein on Brownian Motion



Einstein as a student at the ETH, or shortly thereafter
(Courtesy of Hebrew University of Jerusalem)

Einstein’s study of Brownian motion constitutes one of the
high points in the long tradition of research on the kinetic
theory of heat and of his own contributions to this field
Some of the consequences of his work were of great significance for the development of physics in the twentieth century Einstein’s derivation of the laws governing Brownian
motion, and their subsequent experimental verification by
Perrin and others, contributed significantly to the acknowledgment of the physical reality of atoms by the then stillnumerous skeptics His papers on Brownian motion helped
to establish the study of fluctuation phenomena as a new
branch of physics The methods he created in the course of
his research prepared the way for statistical thermodynamics, later developed by Szilard and others, and for a general
theory of stochastic processes
Since at least the middle of the nineteenth century, a
growing number of physicists and chemists had accepted
the atomic hypothesis The assumption that matter consists
of atoms and molecules suggested a number of relations between phenomena, both physical and chemical, that are unexpected from a purely macroscopic point of view Various
methods for the determination of molecular dimensions gave
values that were often in surprisingly good agreement The
physical reality of atoms was not, however, universally accepted by the end of the century There were still some fervent opponents of the atomic hypothesis, such as Wilhelm
Ostwald and Georg Helm, who called themselves “energeticists” to indicate that they regarded the concept of energy as
the most fundamental ontological concept of science Others, such as Ernst Mach, while adopting a hostile position
73

PART TWO

with regard to the existence of entities not directly accessible to sense experience—in particular, atoms—admitted that
atomism may have a heuristic or didactic utility It was not
uncommon, even among scientists who made explicit use of
atomic assumptions in their work, to regard atomism as a
mere working hypothesis
Although at the turn of the century the atomic hypothesis
was proving its heuristic value in such new areas of research
as the electron theory of metals and stereochemistry, some
physicists had come to regard the theory of heat as an area
in which the atomic hypothesis was no longer fruitful Einstein probably became aware of the controversy over the
molecular theory of heat during his student years, when he
read works by Mach, Ostwald, and Boltzmann In 1900 Einstein finished reading Boltzmann’s Gastheorie (1896, 1898),
in which Boltzmann, presumably reacting to a dispute with
Ostwald and Helm, suggested that he was isolated in his support of the kinetic theory Although he criticized Boltzmann
for a lack of emphasis on the comparison of his theory with
observation, Einstein was firmly convinced of the principles
of Boltzmann’s theory
In his first published attempts at independent research,
Einstein took for granted the atomistic constitution of matter and of electricity He developed a theory of molecular
forces, on the basis of which he established a number of
relations among observable phenomena Einstein’s interest
soon shifted from the details of molecular forces to the quest
for facts, “which would guarantee as much as possible the
existence of atoms of definite finite size,” as he later characterized this phase of his work1
The irregular movement of microscopic particles suspended in a liquid had been noted long before the botanist
74

EINSTEIN ON BROWNIAN MOTION

Robert Brown published his careful observations in 1828,
but Brown was the first to emphasize its ubiquity and to
exclude its explanation as a vital phenomenon Advances in
observational technique and in theory served to eliminate
a number of unsatisfactory explanations of Brownian motion
by the end of the nineteenth century, if not to verify the correct one Explanations of Brownian motion proposed after
the exclusion of vital forces involved capillarity, convection
currents, evaporation, interaction with light, and electrical
forces During the 1870s, the kinetic theory of heat was proposed as an explanation by several authors A powerful argument against this explanation was developed by the cytologist Karl von Nägeli in 1879 He first used the equipartition
theorem to calculate the average velocity of the molecules
of the liquid, and then used the laws of elastic collision to
obtain the velocity of a suspended particle He concluded
that the velocity of such a particle, because of its comparatively large mass, would be vanishingly small William Ramsay and Louis-Georges Gouy independently tried to defend
the molecular explanation of Brownian motion by assuming the existence of collective motions of large numbers of
atoms in liquids, an assumption suited to the refutation of
arguments such as Nägeli’s
In 1900 an entirely different way of applying the kinetic
theory of heat to Brownian motion was investigated by Felix Exner, who assumed an equipartition of energy between
the molecules of the liquid and the suspended particles He
calculated the velocity of the molecules on the basis of observations that he interpreted as giving the mean velocities
of the suspended particles, obtaining results that were not
in agreement with contemporary estimates of molecular velocities In Exner’s work there is no fundamental difference
75

PART TWO

between a solute molecule and a suspended particle Einstein
arrived at a similar conclusion, but instead of emphasizing the
equipartition theorem, he took the osmotic pressure and its
relation to the theory of diffusion and to the molecular theory
of heat as the starting point of his analysis of Brownian motion He writes in the paper that follows: “According to this
theory, a dissolved molecule differs from a suspended body
in size, only and it is difficult to see why suspended bodies
should not produce the same osmotic pressure as an equal
number of dissolved molecules” (see pp 86–87)
On the other hand, Einstein pointed out, according to the
“classical theory of thermodynamics,” suspended particles—
as macroscopic objects—should not exert an osmotic pressure on a semipermeable wall Before Einstein, no one
seems to have recognized that this contrast provides a
touchstone for the kinetic theory His choice of a suspension to study the relations between the thermodynamic
and atomic theories of heat amounted to a radical reversal
of perspective Usually the legitimacy of microscopic explanations of thermodynamic results was at issue In this
case, however, the question centered on the applicability of
a thermodynamic concept—osmotic pressure—to the suspended particles
In the course of studying colloidal solutions, the commonly made distinction between suspensions and solutions
in nineteenth-century chemistry had lost its absolute character The absence of any fundamental difference between
solutions and suspensions was made strikingly clear in 1902,
when observations performed with the newly invented ultramicroscope made it possible to resolve many colloidal
solutions into their constituents The ultramicroscope not
only demonstrated the physical reality of colloidal particles,
76

EINSTEIN ON BROWNIAN MOTION

but showed that irregular motion is one of their outstanding
characteristics
Although the ultramicroscope brought closer what Jean
Perrin called the “distant reality” of molecules, one of their
fundamental properties, their velocities, remained inaccessible to measurement The inconsistencies that result
from presumed velocity measurements, such as Exner’s, had
hinted at this problem; but it was explicitly discussed for
the first time in the theoretical studies of Brownian motion
that Einstein and Smoluchowski independently published
between 1905 and 1907 Both introduced the mean-square
displacement of the suspended particles as the primary observable quantity in Brownian motion Einstein argued that
dissipative forces change the direction and magnitude of the
velocity of a suspended particle on such a short timescale
that it cannot be measured This argument demonstrates
the fundamental role of dissipation in Einstein’s analysis of
Brownian motion
In summary, the study of previous explanations of Brownian motion shows that three elements of Einstein’s approach
are characteristic of his decisive progress: (1) he based his
analysis on the osmotic pressure rather than on the equipartition theorem; (2) he identified the mean-square displacements of suspended particles rather than their velocities
as suitable observable quantities; and (3) he simultaneously
applied the molecular theory of heat and the macroscopic
theory of dissipation to the same phenomenon, rather than
restricting each of these conceptual tools to a single scale,
molecular or macroscopic
In the paper on Brownian motion (paper 2), Einstein
proved “that, on the assumption of the molecular theory
77

PART TWO

of heat, bodies of the order of magnitude of 1/1000 mm
suspended in liquids must already carry out an observable
random movement, which is generated by thermal motion,”
as he wrote in a letter to Conrad Habicht in the late spring
of 1905 Einstein wrote this paper “without knowing that
observations concerning Brownian motion were already long
familiar”2 He did not mention Brownian motion in the title, although he conjectured that the motion he predicted
might be identical to Brownian motion Boltzmann’s Gastheorie, which Einstein carefully studied during his student
years, explicitly denies that the thermal motion of molecules
in a gas leads to observable motions of suspended bodies
(This denial may be an instance of what Einstein referred to
as Boltzmann’s attaching too little importance to a comparison of theory with observation) Sometime between 1902
and 1905, Einstein read Poincaré’s Science et hypothèse,
which contains a brief discussion of Gouy’s work on Brownian motion, emphasizing Gouy’s argument that Brownian
motion violates the second law of thermodynamics Einstein’s second paper on Brownian motion,3 written after
Siedentopf drew his attention to Gouy’s work, cites Gouy’s
observations as qualitative confirmation of his results
Paper 2 opens with the derivation of an expression for the
diffusion coefficient in terms of the radius of the suspended
particles and the temperature and viscosity of the liquid, an
expression already obtained in Einstein’s doctoral dissertation Unlike the previous derivation, however, the new one
makes use of the methods of statistical physics that Einstein
developed The new approach is different in two respects:
1 In his dissertation, which deals with solutions rather than
suspensions, Einstein simply assumed the validity of van’t
78

EINSTEIN ON BROWNIAN MOTION

Hoff’s law for the osmotic pressure He now gave a derivation of this law from an expression for the free energy of the
suspension that follows from statistical mechanics
2 Rather than simply considering the equilibrium of forces acting on a single molecule, Einstein derived the equilibrium
between the osmotic pressure and a friction force obeying
Stokes’s law by a thermodynamical argument

The ensuing derivation of the diffusion equation is based
on the introduction of a probability distribution for displacements The introduction of such a distribution is presumably
related to Einstein’s previous use of probability distributions
Einstein assumed the existence of a time interval, short with
respect to the observation time, yet sufficiently long that the
motions of a suspended particle in two successive time intervals can be treated as independent of each other The displacement of the suspended particles can then be described
by a probability distribution that determines the number of
particles displaced by a certain distance in each time interval Einstein derived the diffusion equation from an analysis of the time-dependence of the particle distribution, calculated from the probability distribution for displacements
This derivation is based on his crucial insight into the role
of Brownian motion as the microscopic process responsible for diffusion on a macroscopic scale Compared to such
a derivation, one based on an analogy to the treatment of
diffusion in the kinetic theory of gases may have appeared
more problematic to Einstein because of the lack of a fully
developed kinetic theory of liquids
The solution of the resulting diffusion equation, combined
with his expression for the diffusion coefficient, yields an expression for the mean-square displacement, λx , as a function

where t is the time, R the gas constant, T the temperature,
k the viscosity, and P the radius of the suspended particles
Through his earlier work, Einstein was familiar with the
theory of diffusion in both gases and liquids, as well as with
other techniques needed for his analysis of Brownian motion In 1902 he suggested the replacement of semipermeable
walls in thermodynamic arguments by external conservative
forces, a method he stated to be particularly useful for treating arbitrary mixtures During 1903 Einstein discussed the
notions of semipermeable membrane and osmotic pressure
in his correspondence with Michele Besso, showing interest
in Sutherland’s hypothesis on the mechanism of semipermeable membranes In his papers on statistical physics, Einstein generalized the idea of external conservative forces and
noted the significant role of fluctuations in statistical physics
In 1904 he derived an expression for mean square deviations
from the average value of the energy of a system
Several newly perfected techniques for the experimental
investigation of Brownian motion, notably the ultramicroscope and new methods for preparing colloidal solutions,
were available by the time Einstein published his first articles on the subject As one of the first applications of the ultramicroscope, Siedentopf and Zsigmondy observed Brownian motion in colloidal solutions but did not perform precise
measurements Les ultramicroscopes et les objets ultramicroscopiques, a book on the ultramicroscope and its applications by Aimé Cotton and Henri Mouton, published in 1906,
80

EINSTEIN ON BROWNIAN MOTION

helped stimulate interest in Brownian motion and brought
Einstein’s theory to the attention of researchers in the field
Using an ultramicroscope and a sophisticated observational
technique, The Svedberg carried out careful measurements
of Brownian motion with the aim of testing the interpretation of Brownian motion that maintains it is caused by the
thermal motions of molecules Svedberg reported on his attempts to test Einstein’s theory in 1906 and corresponded
with Einstein on the subject of Brownian motion, sending
him one of his papers
Svedberg followed Zsigmondy in assuming two types of
motions for colloidal particles, a translational motion and a
“proper [Brownian] motion” Svedberg restricted his attention to the latter and attempted to facilitate its measurement
by superimposing a translational motion He described the
resulting trajectories as “sinusoid-like,” but cautioned against
concluding that the motion had an oscillatory character4 In
the analysis of his results, however, Svedberg introduced a
terminology that was adapted to the description of a simple
oscillatory motion, relating the observed amplitudes to Einstein’s root-mean-square displacement Earlier, he had tried
to estimate molecular velocities on the basis of the observed
velocities of colloidal particles In another article, written
mainly to correct the basic misunderstandings in Svedberg’s
work, Einstein showed that the velocities of ultramicroscopic
particles, as calculated from the equipartition theorem, cannot be directly observed5 On 11 November 1909, Einstein
wrote to Perrin: “The errors in Svedberg’s method of observation and also in his theoretical treatment became clear to
me at once I wrote a minor correction at the time, which
only addressed the worst ones, as I couldn’t bring myself to
detract from Mr S’s great pleasure in his work”
81

PART TWO

In addition to the misconceptions underlying Svedberg’s
experimental work, his numerical results slightly disagreed
with Einstein’s predictions Other early experimental work
on Einstein’s and Smoluchowski’s theories, such as Felix
Ehrenhaft’s observations of displacements of aerosol particles, Victor Henri’s cinematographical measurements of
displacements of suspended particles, or Max Seddig’s study
of the temperature dependence of Brownian motion, provided qualitative confirmation of the theory; but the work of
Henri and Seddig also failed to yield quantitative agreement
As a consequence, the kinetic interpretation of Brownian
motion was not universally accepted in 1908 as the exclusive
explanation of the phenomenon
Einstein noted that the control of the temperature was
the principal difficulty in obtaining satisfactory results from
the photographic records of Seddig and Henri Before Jean
Perrin published his thorough experimental investigation of
the phenomenon, Einstein was skeptical about the possibility of obtaining precise measurements of Brownian motion
On 30 July 1908, in a letter to Jakob Laub, Einstein commented rather enthusiastically on Seddig’s work in spite of
its shortcomings: “I have read Seddig’s paper He has done
it very well I cannot quite make head or tail of his descriptions of the results” Einstein wrote to Jean Perrin on 11
November the following year: “I would have considered it
impossible to investigate Brownian motion so precisely; it is
a stroke of luck for this subject that you have taken it up”
In a series of experiments, the first results of which were
published in 1908, Perrin achieved an until then unmatched
precision in the confirmation of almost all of Einstein’s predictions Like Einstein, Perrin recognized that the analogy
established by van’t Hoff between an ideal gas and a solution
82

EINSTEIN ON BROWNIAN MOTION

could be extended to colloidal solutions and suspensions, and
that this analogy provides a unique means of obtaining evidence for atomism In his first experiments on Brownian
motion, Perrin tested a formula for the vertical distribution
of suspended particles under the influence of gravitation
Although Perrin probably was aware of Einstein’s theory
through Langevin, he was apparently unaware that Einstein
had derived a similar formula Challenged by criticism, Perrin
checked his assumption of the validity of Stokes’s formula for
the particles used in his experiments In two further papers
published in 1908, Perrin applied his methods to a determination of Avogadro’s number
In the same year, Perrin’s doctoral student Chaudesaigues
subjected Einstein’s displacement formula to experimental
tests Contrary to Henri’s results mentioned above, the results are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions
Perrin continued these successful experiments with the help
of other students; to Einstein’s surprise, he was able to include rotational Brownian motion in his investigations On
11 November 1909, Einstein wrote to Perrin: “I would not
have considered a measurement of the rotations as feasible In my eyes it was only a pretty trifle” Perrin’s success
was based on the ingenious combination of several experimental techniques for preparing emulsions with precisely
controllable particle sizes, and for measuring the particles’
number and displacements He summarized his results in
various review articles and books that significantly furthered
the general acceptance of atomism
Beginning in 1907, Einstein himself tried to contribute to
the experimental study of fluctuation phenomena His prediction of voltage fluctuations in condensers stimulated him
to explore the possibility of measuring small quantities of
83

PART TWO

electricity in order to provide experimental support for “a
phenomenon in the field of electricity related to Brownian
motion”6 On 15 July 1907, he wrote to his friends Conrad
and Paul Habicht about his discovery of a method for the
measurement of small quantities of electrical energy Soon
afterward the Habichts tried to build the device proposed
by Einstein At the end of 1907, Einstein dropped his idea
of obtaining a patent for the device, as he wrote on 24 December to Conrad Habicht, “primarily because of the lack
of interest by manufacturers” Instead, he published a paper on the basic features of his method, which stimulated
further work on the device7 While the use of the device
for measuring fluctuation phenomena in conductors proved
to be difficult, experimental work done by others soon provided evidence for the atomistic constitution of matter and
electricity that exceeded Einstein’s initial expectations

On the Motion of Small Particles
Suspended in Liquids at Rest
Required by the
Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat

In this paper it will be shown that, according to the
molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of a microscopically
visible size suspended in liquids must, as a result of thermal molecular motions, perform motions of such magnitude
that they can be easily observed with a microscope It is
possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with so-called Brownian molecular motion; however, the
data available to me on the latter are so imprecise that I
could not form a judgment on the question
If the motion to be discussed here can actually be observed, together with the laws it is expected to obey, then
classical thermodynamics can no longer be viewed as applying to regions that can be distinguished even with a microscope, and an exact determination of actual atomic sizes
becomes possible On the other hand, if the prediction of
this motion were to be proved wrong, this fact would pro85

vide a far-reaching argument against the molecular-kinetic
conception of heat
1 On the Osmotic Pressure to Be Ascribed to
Suspended Particles
Let z gram-molecules of a non-electrolyte be dissolved in a
part V ∗ of the total volume V of a liquid If the volume V ∗ is
separated from the pure solvent by a wall that is permeable
to the solvent but not to the solute, then this wall is subjected to a so-called osmotic pressure, which for sufficiently
large values of V ∗ /z satisfies the equation
pV ∗ = RTz

But if instead of the solute, the partial volume V ∗ of the
liquid contains small suspended bodies that also cannot pass
through the solvent-permeable wall, then, according to the
classical theory of thermodynamics, we should not expect—
at least if we neglect the force of gravity, which does not
interest us here—any pressure to be exerted on the wall;
for according to the usual interpretation, the “free energy”
of the system does not seem to depend on the position of
the wall and of the suspended bodies, but only on the total
mass and properties of the suspended substance, the liquid,
and the wall, as well as on the pressure and temperature To
be sure, the energy and entropy of the interfaces (capillary
forces) should also be considered when calculating the free
energy; but we can disregard them here because changes in
the position of the wall and suspended bodies will not cause
changes in the size and state of the contact surfaces
But a different interpretation arises from the standpoint
of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat According to this
86

MOTION OF SMALL PARTICLES

theory, a dissolved molecule differs from a suspended body
only in size, and it is difficult to see why suspended bodies
should not produce the same osmotic pressure as an equal
number of dissolved molecules We have to assume that the
suspended bodies perform an irregular, albeit very slow, motion in the liquid due to the liquid’s molecular motion; if
prevented by the wall from leaving the volume V ∗ , they will
exert pressure upon the wall just like molecules in solution
Thus, if n suspended bodies are present in the volume V ∗ ,
ie, n/V ∗ = ν in a unit volume, and if neighboring bodies
are sufficiently far separated from each other, there will be
a corresponding osmotic pressure p of magnitude
p = RT∗ n = RT · ν

where N denotes the number of actual molecules per

Let us call the rectangular coordinates of the center

the infinitesimally small parallelepiped regions dx1 dy1 dz1 ,
dx2 dy2 dz2    dxn dyn dzn , all of which lie in V ∗  We want
to evaluate the integral occurring in the expression for F ,
with the restriction that the centers of gravity of the particles shall lie in the regions just assigned to them In any
case, this integral can be put into the form
dB = dx1 dy1    dzn · J 

where J is independent of dx1 dy1 , etc, as well as of V ∗ , ie,
of the position of the semipermeable wall But J is also independent of the particular choice of the positions of the center of gravity regions and of the value of V ∗ , as will be shown
immediately For if a second system of infinitesimally small
regions were assigned to the centers of gravity of the particles and denoted by dx′1 dy1′ dz′1 , dx′2 dy2′ dz′2    dx′n dyn′ dz′n ,
and if these regions differed from the originally assigned
ones by their position alone, but not by their size, and if,
likewise, all of them were contained in V ∗ , we would similarly have
dB′ = dx′1 dy1′    dz′n · J ′ 

But from the molecular theory of heat, as presented in

are respectively equal to the probabilities that at an arbitrarily chosen moment the centers of gravity of the particles
will be found in the regions dx1    dzn and dx′1    dz′n
respectively If the motions of the individual particles are
independent of one another (to a sufficient approximation)
and if the liquid is homogeneous and no forces act on the
particles, then for regions of the same size the probabilities

numbers of solute molecules and suspended particles behave
identically as regards osmotic pressure
3 Theory of Diffusion of Small
Suspended Spheres
Suppose suspended particles are randomly distributed in a
liquid We will investigate their state of dynamic equilibrium
under the assumption that a force K, which depends on the
position but not on the time, acts on the individual particles
For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume that the force acts
everywhere in the direction of the X-axis
If the number of suspended particles per unit volume is ν,
then in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium ν is a function of x such that the variation of the free energy vanishes
for an arbitrary virtual displacement δx of the suspended
substance Thus
δF = δE − T δS = 0

Let us assume that the liquid has a unit cross section perpendicular to the X-axis, and that it is bounded by the planes
x = 0 and x = l We then have
δE = −

The last equation asserts that the force K is equilibrated by
the force of osmotic pressure
We can use equation (1) to determine the diffusion coefficient of the suspended substance We can look upon the dynamic equilibrium state considered here as a superposition
of two processes proceeding in opposite directions, namely:
1 A motion of the suspended substance under the influence of
the force K that acts on each suspended particle
2 A process of diffusion, which is to be regarded as the result of the disordered motions of the particles produced by
thermal molecular motion

If the suspended particles have spherical form (where P
is the radius of the sphere) and the coefficient of viscosity
of the liquid is k, then the force K imparts to an individual
particle the velocity3

From the two conditions (1) and (2) found for dynamic

get

Thus, except for universal constants and the absolute temperature, the diffusion coefficient of the suspended substance depends only on the viscosity of the liquid and on
the size of the suspended particles
4 On the Disordered Motion of Particles
Suspended in a Liquid
and Its Relation to Diffusion
We shall now turn to a closer examination of the disordered
motions that arise from thermal molecular motion and give
rise to the diffusion investigated in the last section
Obviously, we must assume that each individual particle
executes a motion that is independent of the motions of
all the other particles; the motions of the same particle in
different time intervals must also be considered as mutually
independent processes, so long as we think of these time
intervals as chosen not to be too small
93

PAPER 2

We now introduce a time interval τ, which is very small
compared with observable time intervals but still large
enough that the motions performed by a particle during two
consecutive time intervals τ can be considered as mutually
independent events
Suppose, now, that a total of n suspended particles is
present in a liquid In a time interval τ, the X-coordinates
of the individual particles will increase by , where  has a
different (positive or negative) value for each particle A certain probability distribution law will hold for : the number
dn of particles experiencing a displacement that lies between
 and  + d in the time interval τ will be expressed by an
equation of the form
dn = nϕ  d

where
 +∞

ϕ  d = 1

−∞

and ϕ differs from zero only for very small values of  and
satisfies the condition
ϕ  = ϕ − 

We will now investigate how the diffusion coefficient depends on ϕ, restricting ourselves again to the case where
the number ν of particles per unit volume only depends on
x and t
Let ν = f x t be the number of particles per unit volume; we calculate the distribution of particles at time t + τ
from their distribution at time t From the definition of the
function ϕ  we can easily obtain the number of particles

But since τ is very small, we can put

(3)

This is the well-known differential equation for diffusion,
and we recognize that D is the diffusion coefficient
Another important point can be linked to this argument
We have assumed that the individual particles are all referred to the same coordinate system However, this is not
necessary since the motions of the individual particles are
mutually independent We will now refer the motion of each
particle to a coordinate system whose origin coincides with
the position of the center of gravity of the particle in question at time t = 0, with the difference that f x t dx now
denotes the number of particles whose X-coordinate has increased between the times t = 0 and t = t by a quantity
that lies somewhere between x and x + dx Thus, the function f varies according to equation (1) in this case as well2
Further, it is obvious that for x  0 and t = 0 we must have
f x t = 0 and

of random errors, which was to be expected What is important, however, is how the constant in the exponent is related
to the diffusion coefficient With the help of this equation
we can now calculate the displacement λx in the direction
of the X-axis that a particle experiences on the average, or,
to be more precise, the root-mean-square displacement in
the X-direction; it is
λx =

This equation shows how λx depends on T , k, and P 
We will now calculate how large λx is for one second if

the kinetic theory of gases; water at 17◦ C k = 135 · 10−2
is chosen as the liquid,3 and the diameter of the particles
is 0001 mm We get
λx = 8 · 10−5 cm = 08 micron

Therefore, the mean displacement in one minute would be
about 6 microns
Conversely, the relation can be used to determine N We
obtain
N = t2 · RT 

Let us hope that a researcher will soon succeed in solving
the problem presented here, which is so important for the
theory of heat

Einstein on the Theory of Relativity



Part of Einstein’s 1912 manuscript on the special theory of relativity, showing the
equation E = mc2  (Courtesy of Hebrew University of Jerusalem)

Einstein was the first physicist to formulate clearly the
new kinematical foundation for all of physics inherent in
Lorentz’s electron theory This kinematics emerged in 1905
from his critical examination of the physical significance of
the concepts of spatial and temporal intervals The examination, based on a careful definition of the simultaneity
of distant events, showed that the concept of a universal
or absolute time, on which Newtonian kinematics is based,
has to be abandoned; and that the Galilean transformations
between the coordinates of two inertial frames of reference has to be replaced by a set of spatial and temporal
transformations that agree formally with a set that Lorentz
had introduced earlier with a quite different interpretation Through the interpretation of these transformations as
elements of a space-time symmetry group corresponding
to the new kinematics, the special theory of relativity (as it
later came to be called) provided physicists with a powerful guide in the search for new dynamical theories of fields
and particles and gradually led to a deeper appreciation of
the role of symmetry criteria in physics The special theory of relativity also provided philosophers with abundant
material for reflection on the new views of space and time
The special theory, like Newtonian mechanics, still assigns a
privileged status to the class of inertial frames of reference
The attempt to generalize the theory to include gravitation led Einstein to formulate the equivalence principle in
1907 This was the first step in his search for a new theory
of gravitation denying a privileged role to inertial frames, a
theory that is now known as the general theory of relativity
101

PART THREE

Einstein presented the special theory in paper 3, which is
a landmark in the development of modern physics In the
first part of this paper Einstein presented the new kinematics, basing it on two postulates, the relativity principle and
the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light In
the second part, he applied his kinematical results to the
solution of a number of problems in the optics and electrodynamics of moving bodies In paper 4, Einstein presents
arguments for one of the most important consequences of
the theory, the equivalence of mass and energy
Strictly speaking, it is anachronistic to use the term “theory
of relativity” in discussing Einstein’s first papers on the subject In them he referred to the “principle of relativity” Max
Planck used the term “Relativtheorie” in 1906 to describe the
Lorentz-Einstein equations of motion for the electron, and
this expression continued to be used from time to time for
several years A H Bucherer seems to have been the first
person to use the term “Relativitätstheorie” in the discussion
following Planck’s lecture The term was used in an article by
Paul Ehrenfest and adopted by Einstein in 1907 in his reply
to this article Although Einstein used the term from time
to time thereafter, for several years he continued to employ
“Relativitätsprinzip” in the titles of his articles In 1910 the
mathematician Felix Klein suggested the name “Invariantentheorie” (theory of invariants), but this suggestion does not
seem to have been adopted by any physicist In 1915 Einstein started to refer to his earlier work as “the special theory
of relativity” to contrast it with his later “general theory”
In his 1905 paper, as well as in his 1907 and 1909 reviews of
the theory, Einstein described the theory of relativity as arising from a specific problem: the apparent conflict between
102

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

the principle of relativity and the Maxwell-Lorentz theory
of electrodynamics While the relativity principle asserts the
physical equivalence of all inertial frames of reference, the
Maxwell-Lorentz theory implies the existence of a privileged
inertial frame
The principle of relativity originated in classical mechanics Assuming Newton’s laws of motion and central force
interactions, it can be demonstrated that it is impossible to
determine the state of motion of an inertial frame by means
of mechanical experiments carried out within a closed system with center of mass at rest in this frame This conclusion, well known and empirically well confirmed by the end
of the nineteenth century, was sometimes called the principle of relative motion, or principle of relativity
The introduction of velocity-dependent forces between
charged particles led to doubts about the validity of the
relativity principle for magnetic interactions The wave theory of light appeared to invalidate the principle for optical
phenomena This theory seemed to require an all-pervading
medium, the so-called luminiferous ether, to explain the
propagation of light in the absence of ordinary matter The
assumption that the ether moves together with matter seems
to be excluded by the phenomenon of aberration and by
Fizeau’s results on the velocity of light in moving media If
the ether is not dragged with matter, it should be possible to
detect motion relative to a reference frame fixed in the ether
by means of optical experiments However, all attempts to
detect the motion of the earth through the ether by optical
experiments failed
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory was intended to provide
a unified explanation of electric, magnetic, and optical phenomena With its advent, the question arose of the status of
103

PART THREE

the principle of relativity for such phenomena Does the
principle follow from the fundamental equations of electrodynamics? The answer to this question depends on the
form of Maxwell’s equations postulated for bodies in motion Hertz developed an electrodynamics of moving bodies,
based on the assumption that the ether moves with matter, in which the relativity principle holds In addition to its
inability to account for the optical phenomena mentioned
above, Hertz’s theory was unable to explain several new electromagnetic phenomena, and it soon fell out of favor
By the turn of this century, when Einstein started working on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, Lorentz’s
very successful version of Maxwell’s theory had gained wide
acceptance Lorentz’s electrodynamics is based on a microscopic theory that came to be known as the electron
theory The theory makes a sharp distinction between
ordinary, ponderable matter and the ether Ordinary matter is composed of finite-sized material particles, at least
some of which are electrically charged All of space, even
those regions occupied by material particles, is pervaded by
the ether, a medium with no mechanical properties, such
as mass The ether is the seat of all electric and magnetic
fields Matter only influences the ether through charged
particles, which create these fields The ether only acts on
matter through the electric and magnetic forces that the
fields exert on charged particles By assuming such atoms
of electricity (“electrons”), Lorentz’s theory incorporates an
important element of the pre-Maxwellian continental tradition into Maxwell’s theory, from which it took the field
equations
The parts of the ether are assumed to be immobile relative to each other Hence, Lorentz’s ether defines a rigid
104

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

reference frame, which is assumed to be inertial It is in this
frame that Maxwell’s equations are valid; in other frames, the
Galilei-transformed form of these equations hold Hence it
should be possible to detect the motion of the earth through
the ether by suitably designed terrestrial electromagnetic or
optical experiments Lorentz was well aware of the failure
of all attempts to detect the motion of the earth through
the ether, in particular such sensitive optical attempts as the
Michelson-Morley experiment, and attempted to explain this
failure on the basis of his theory
His basic approach to this problem in 1895 was to use
the theorem of “corresponding states” in combination with
the well-known contraction hypothesis The theorem is essentially a calculational tool that sets up a correspondence
between phenomena in moving systems and those in stationary systems by introducing transformed coordinates
and fields On this basis, Lorentz was able to account for
the failure of most electromagnetic experiments to detect
the motion of the earth through the ether In 1904 he
showed how to explain the failure of all such experiments
by a generalization of his theorem He introduced a set
of transformations for the spatial and temporal coordinates
(soon named the “Lorentz transformations” by Poincaré)
and for the electric and magnetic field components, such
that by using these transformations, Maxwell’s equations, in
the absence of charges, take the same form in all inertial
frames Lorentz’s approach to the explanation of the failure
of attempts to detect motion through the ether, thus, was to
show that the basic equations of the electron theory, in spite
of the fact that they single out the ether rest frame, can
still explain this failure of all optical and electromagnetic
attempts to detect the earth’s motion through the ether
105

PART THREE

Einstein’s work was based on a new outlook on the problem Instead of regarding the failure of electromagnetic and
optical experiments to detect the earth’s motion through the
ether as something to be deduced from the electrodynamical equations, he took this failure as empirical evidence for
the validity of the principle of relativity in electrodynamics
and optics Indeed, he asserted the universal validity of the
principle, making it a criterion for the acceptability of any
physical law In this respect he gave the principle of relativity a role similar to that of the principles of thermodynamics,
an example that he later stated helped to guide him Rather
than being deductions from other theories, such principles
are taken as postulates for deductive chains of reasoning, resulting in the formulation of general criteria that all physical
theories must satisfy
Einstein now confronted the problem of making MaxwellLorentz electrodynamics compatible with the principle of
relativity He did so by means of a principle drawn from this
very electrodynamics, the principle of the constancy of the
velocity of light That the velocity of light is independent
of that of its source, and has a constant value in the ether
rest frame, can be deduced from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory Einstein dropped the ether from that theory and took
the constancy of the velocity of light as a second postulate, supported by all the empirical evidence in favor of the
Maxwell-Lorentz theory When combined with the relativity
principle, this leads to an apparently paradoxical conclusion:
the velocity of light must be the same in all inertial frames
This result conflicts with the Newtonian law of addition of
velocities, forcing a revision of the kinematical foundations
underlying all of physics Einstein showed that the simultaneity of distant events is only defined physically relative
106

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

to a particular inertial frame, leading to kinematical transformations between the spatial and temporal coordinates of
two inertial frames that agree formally with the transformations that Lorentz had introduced in 1904
Einstein next considered the implications of the new kinematics for electrodynamics and mechanics By eliminating
the concept of the ether, he in effect asserted that electromagnetic fields do not require an underlying substratum He
showed that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for empty space
remain invariant in form under the new kinematical transformations when the transformation laws for the electric and
magnetic fields are appropriately defined He deduced appropriate transformation laws for charge densities and velocities from the requirement that Maxwell’s equations remain
invariant when convection currents are added Finally, by assuming that Newton’s equations hold for a charged particle
at rest, he was able to use a kinematical transformation to
deduce the equations of motion of a charged particle (“electron”) with arbitrary velocity
The problems connected with the formulation of an electrodynamics of moving bodies consistent with all experimental evidence were discussed frequently during the years
Einstein was working on his theory Statements similar to
many of the individual points made in paper 3 occur in the
contemporary literature, and Einstein may well have been
familiar with some of the books and articles in which they
are found But his approach to the problem, leading to the
peculiar combination of these ideas in his paper, is unique—
particularly the recognition that a new kinematics of universal applicability is needed as the basis for a consistent approach to the electrodynamics of moving bodies
107

PART THREE

Einstein’s work on relativity grew out of his long-standing
interest in the electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies His first scientific essay, written in 1895, discussed the
propagation of light through the ether The next year, as
he later recalled, the following problem started to puzzle
him: “If one were to pursue a light wave with the velocity
of light, one would be confronted with a time-independent
wave field Such a thing doesn’t seem to exist, however! This
was the first childlike thought-experiment concerned with
the special theory of relativity”1
By this time Einstein presumably was familiar with the
principle of relativity in classical mechanics While preparing for the ETH entrance examination in 1895, he had studied the German edition of Violle’s textbook Violle actually
based his treatment of dynamics on the “principle of relative
motions” together with the principle of inertia
About 1898, Einstein started to study Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, apparently with the help of Drude’s textbook By 1899, after studying Hertz’s papers on the subject,
he was at work on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
He discussed this topic a number of times in letters to
Mileva Marić between 1899 and 1901; once, on 27 March
1901, he referred to “our work on relative motion” In December 1901, Einstein also explained his ideas on the subject to Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich,
who encouraged him to publish them; but there is no evidence that Kleiner played a further role in the development
of these ideas
Einstein’s comments show that in 1899 his viewpoint on
electrodynamics was similar to that of Lorentz; but, aside
from this similarity, there is no evidence that Einstein had
yet read anything by Lorentz Shortly afterward, Einstein
108

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

designed an experiment to test the effect of the motion of
bodies relative to the ether on the propagation of light; in
1901 he designed a second such experiment, but was unable
to carry out either one On 17 December 1901, he reported
to Marić that he was at work on “a capital paper” on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, asserting his renewed conviction of the correctness of his “ideas on relative motion” His
words may indicate that he already doubted whether motion with respect to the ether is experimentally detectable
Soon afterward he wrote that he intended to study Lorentz’s
theory in earnest
There is direct or strong indirect contemporary evidence
that, by 1902, Einstein had read or was reading works on
electrodynamics and optics by Drude, Helmholtz, Hertz,
Lorentz, Voigt, Wien, and Föppl Comments in his letters
on articles published in the Annalen der Physik between
1898 and 1901 indicate that during those years he looked at
that journal regularly as well, and studied a number of articles in it It is reasonable to suppose that he continued to
do so between 1902 and 1905 During these years a number of significant articles on the electrodynamics and optics
of moving bodies appeared in the Annalen He cited several
works published before 1905 in his later articles on relativity,
and it is possible that he read one or more of these before
1905 Einstein also read extensively on the foundations of
science He later attributed great significance for his development of the theory of relativity to his reading of Hume,
Mach, and Poincaré
Belief in the reality of the ether was widespread at the
turn of the century However, Einstein was familiar with several works that questioned the certainty of its existence Mill,
in the course of a discussion of “the Hypothetical Method”
109

PART THREE

in his Logic, gives a number of reasons for skepticism concerning “the prevailing hypothesis of a luminiferous ether”2
Poincaré, in La science et l’hypothèse, raised the question
of the existence of the ether, even if he offered no clear
answer Ostwald, in his Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Chemie,
suggested that the ether hypothesis could be replaced by a
purely energetic treatment of radiation
Few contemporary documents throw any light on Einstein’s work on electrodynamics between 1902 and 1905
On 22 January 1903, he wrote Michele Besso: “In the near
future I want to deal with molecular forces in gases, and
then make a comprehensive study of electron theory” On 5
December 1903, Einstein gave a talk to the Naturforschende Gesellschaft Bern on “The Theory of Electromagnetic
Waves” By the time he wrote his friend Conrad Habicht
in May or June 1905, the theory was practically complete:
“The    paper exists only as a sketch and is an electrodynamics of moving bodies that utilizes a modification of the
theory of space and time”
Later reminiscences by Einstein suggest several important elements in the development of his ideas on relativity
before “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” was
written that are not recorded in any known contemporary documents In a letter to Erika Oppenheimer on 13
September 1932, he gave a general characterization of “the
situation that led to setting up the theory of special relativity”: “Mechanically all inertial systems are equivalent In
accordance with experience, this equivalence also extends to
optics and electrodynamics However, it did not appear
that this equivalence could be attained in the theory of the
latter I soon reached the conviction that this had its basis
in a deep incompleteness of the theoretical system The
110

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

desire to discover and overcome this generated a state of
psychic tension in me that, after seven years of vain searching, was resolved by relativizing the concepts of time and
length”
In 1952 he wrote: “My direct path to the special theory
of relativity was mainly determined by the conviction that
the electromotive force induced in a conductor moving in
a magnetic field is nothing other than an electric field But
the result of Fizeau’s experiment and the phenomenon of
aberration also guided me”3
Beyond their well-known role as evidence against the assumption that the ether is completely carried along by moving matter, it is not clear what role the result of Fizeau’s
experiment and the phenomenon of aberration played in
Einstein’s thinking Possibly its role depended on the fact
that, in both cases, the observed effect only depends on the
motion of matter (water in the first case, a star in the second) relative to the earth, and not on the presumed motion
of the earth with respect to the ether
In the case of electromagnetic induction, Einstein gave a
more detailed account of its role In 1920, he wrote: “In setting up the special theory of relativity, the following    idea
about Faraday’s electromagnetic induction played a guiding
role According to Faraday, relative motion of a magnet and
a closed electric circuit induces an electric current in the latter Whether the magnet is moved or the conductor doesn’t
matter; only the relative motion is significant    The phenomena of electromagnetic induction    compelled me to
postulate the principle of (special) relativity” In a footnote
he added: “The difficulty to be overcome then lay in the
constancy of the velocity of light in vacuum, which I first
thought would have to be abandoned Only after groping
111

PART THREE

for years did I realize that the difficulty lay in the arbitrariness of the fundamental concepts of kinematics”4
His strong belief in the relativity principle and abandonment of “the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuum”
led Einstein to explore the possibility of an emission theory
of light In such a theory, the velocity of light is only constant relative to that of its source, so it is clearly consistent
with the relativity principle Newton’s corpuscular theory of
light is an emission theory, and Einstein’s search for such
a theory may have been connected with his light-quantum
hypothesis (see paper 5) On 25 April 1912, in a letter to
Paul Ehrenfest commenting on Ritz’s emission theory, Einstein referred to “Ritz’s conception, which before the theory
of relativity was also mine” He expanded on this remark on
20 June: “I knew that the principle of the constancy of the
velocity of light was something quite independent of the relativity postulate, and I weighed which was more probable,
the principle of the constancy of c [the speed of light], as
required by Maxwell’s equations, or the constancy of c exclusively for an observer located at the light source I decided
in favor of the former”
In 1924, Einstein described the sudden resolution of his
dilemma: “After seven years of reflection in vain (1898–
1905), the solution came to me suddenly with the thought
that our concepts and laws of space and time can only claim
validity insofar as they stand in a clear relation to our experiences; and that experience could very well lead to the
alteration of these concepts and laws By a revision of the
concept of simultaneity into a more malleable form, I thus
arrived at the special theory of relativity”5
In a talk at Kyoto University in 1922, Einstein is reported
to have said that, after a year of struggle with the problem of
112

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

how to reconcile Lorentz’s theory with his ideas on relativity,
he visited a friend one day to discuss the problem in detail
with him The next day Einstein said to his friend: “Thanks
to you, I have completely solved my problem”6 The friend
was presumably Michele Besso, then his colleague at the
Swiss Patent Office and the only person whose help is
acknowledged in paper 3
Work on this paper was apparently completed very rapidly
after this In March 1952 Einstein wrote to Carl Seelig that
“between the conception of the idea for the special theory
of relativity and the completion of the relevant publication,
five or six weeks elapsed”
Einstein’s comments suggest the following stages in his
work on the theory of relativity:
1 He became convinced that, as is the case for mechanical
phenomena, only the relative motions of ponderable bodies are significant in determining electromagnetic and optical
phenomena; at some point, this conviction led him to abandon the concept of the ether
2 He temporarily abandoned Lorentz’s theory of electrodynamics, which appears to attach physical significance to absolute motion (ie, motion with respect to empty space or the
ether)
3 He explored the possibility of an alternative electrodynamical
theory, which would justify the emission hypothesis about the
constancy of the velocity of light relative to its source
4 Abandoning such attempts, he reexamined Lorentz’s theory,
at some point focusing his concern on the conflict of his ideas
on relative motion with a particular consequence of Lorentz’s
theory: the independence of velocity of light of the velocity
of its source
113

PART THREE

5 He recognized that this conflict involves previously tacitly
accepted kinematical assumptions about temporal and spatial
intervals, leading him to examine the meaning of the concept
of the simultaneity of distant events
6 He defined simultaneity physically, and constructed a new
kinematical theory based on the relativity principle and the
light principle, thus resolving the apparent conflict between
them

There have been a number of attempts at a detailed
reconstruction of Einstein’s development of the theory of
relativity, attempts which often differ significantly in their
conclusions Such a reconstruction has to take into account
other strands in Einstein’s work at this time In particular,
by the time he wrote the relativity paper, he no longer regarded Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory as universally valid,
and had already proposed his light quantum hypothesis (see
paper 5) He had also shown that the equipartition theorem,
which his work on the foundations of thermodynamics convinced him is valid for the most general classical-mechanical
system, combined with Maxwell’s theory, leads to an incorrect law for black-body radiation (see section 1 of paper 5)
Thus, he already had challenged the unlimited validity of
both classical mechanics and of Maxwell’s theory
Einstein later recalled that, uncertain how to proceed in
the search for better theories of the structure of matter
and radiation, he became convinced that “only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead    to assured
results”7 Such principles play a role analogous in this respect with the role played by the principles of thermodynamics The theory of relativity is based on just such principles:
even though suggested originally by specific mechanical and
114

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

electromagnetic theories, the principles of relativity and of
the constancy of the velocity of light are supported by empirical evidence that is independent of the validity of these
theories
According to his sister’s memoir, Einstein was anxious
about whether his relativity paper would be accepted by the
Annalen der Physik After it was accepted, he eagerly anticipated an immediate reaction to its publication, even though
he expected it to be critical He was greatly disappointed
when his paper was not even mentioned in the following
issues of the Annalen Sometime afterward, she recounts,
he received a letter from Planck, requesting explanations of
a few obscure points in the work “After the long period
of waiting, this was the first sign that his paper was being
read at all The happiness of the young scholar was all the
greater, since acknowledgment of his accomplishment came
from one of the greatest contemporary physicists    At
that time Planck’s interest signified infinitely much for the
morale of the young physicist”8
Planck and Einstein continued to correspond, and during
the fall of 1905 Planck discussed Einstein’s paper in the University of Berlin’s physics colloquium During the next few
years, Planck wrote several papers developing further consequences of the relativity principle, and interested his
assistant, Max Laue, and one of his students, Kurd von
Mosengeil, in working on related problems A few years
later, Einstein paid tribute to Planck’s role in promoting
the theory of relativity: “The attention that this theory so
quickly received from colleagues is surely to be ascribed in
large part to the resoluteness and warmth with which he
intervened for this theory”9
115

PART THREE

Other physicists also started to discuss Einstein’s work in
1905 and 1906 Two months after it appeared, Kaufmann
cited it in a preliminary report of his recent experiments
on the mass of electrons in β-rays The following year, in a
fuller discussion of his results, while noting that the two theories yield the same equations of motion for the electron, he
gave the first clear account of the basic theoretical difference
between Lorentz’s and Einstein’s views Drude, the editor
of the Annalen, cited Einstein’s paper in the second edition
of his standard text on optics, as well as in an article on optics in the Handbuch der Physik Wilhelm Röntgen wrote to
Einstein asking for copies of his papers on electrodynamics,
presumably in connection with a talk Röntgen was to give on
the equations of motion of the electron Sommerfeld, who
heard the talk, soon read Einstein’s work and was so impressed that he decided to give a colloquium on it During
1907, Einstein was in correspondence about the theory
with Planck, Laue, Wien, and Minkowski In the same year,
he was asked to write a review article on relativity, which
appeared in Stark’s Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität at the end
of the year, and a major publishing house inquired about
the possibility of a book on his research A reference by
Ehrenfest in 1907 to Einstein’s theory as a “closed system”
led Einstein to clarify his view of the nature of the theory
By 1908, the theory of relativity, though still controversial
and often not clearly distinguished from Lorentz’s electron theory, was a major topic of discussion among leading
German-speaking physicists
Since the theory of relativity grew out of Einstein’s longstanding concern with electrodynamics, and his applications
of the theory were primarily in this field, the theory was
116

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

often looked upon as essentially another version of Lorentz’s
electron theory Einstein soon felt the need to make clear
the distinction between the kinematical results of the theory,
deduced from the two principles of the theory, and the use
of such kinematical results in the solution of problems in the
optics and electrodynamics of moving bodies, the derivation
of the equations of motion of a charged particle—or indeed
in any physical theory He pointed out that the postulates
of the theory do not constitute a “closed system” but only
a “heuristic principle, which considered by itself alone only
contains assertions about rigid bodies, clocks, and light signals” Beyond such assertions, the theory could only establish
“relations between otherwise apparently independent laws”
of physics10
A few months after first publishing the theory of relativity, Einstein discovered something that particularly intrigued him: the relation between inertial mass and energy
He wrote to Conrad Habicht during the summer of 1905:
“One more consequence of the paper on electrodynamics
has also occurred to me The principle of relativity, in conjunction with Maxwell’s equations, requires that mass be a
direct measure of the energy contained in a body; light carries mass with it A noticeable decrease of mass should occur
in the case of radium The argument is amusing and seductive; but for all I know the Lord might be laughing over it
and leading me around by the nose”
The idea that inertial mass is associated with electromagnetic energy was often discussed before 1905 Around the
turn of the century, it was suggested that all mechanical concepts might be derivable from those of electromagnetism
In particular, there were attempts to derive the entire inertial mass of the electron from the energy associated with its
117

PART THREE

electromagnetic field It was also proved that a radiationfilled container manifests an apparent inertial mass, which
(if the mass of the container is neglected) is proportional to
the energy of the enclosed radiation
In paper 4, Einstein argued that, as a consequence of the
relativity principle, inertial mass is associated with all forms
of energy He was only able to establish this result for a
process involving the emission of electromagnetic radiation
by a system, but argued that the result is independent of the
mechanism by which the system loses energy In addition, he
was only able to show that a change in energy is associated
with a change in inertial mass equal to the change in energy
divided by c2  His argument was criticized in 1907 by Planck,
who presented his own argument to show that a transfer of
heat is associated with a similarly related transfer of inertial
mass
Soon afterward, Stark attributed the discovery of the relation between mass and energy to Planck Einstein wrote
Stark on 17 February 1908: “I was rather disturbed that you
do not acknowledge my priority with regard to the connection
between inertial mass and energy” After receiving a conciliatory reply from Stark, acknowledging his priority, Einstein
replied on 22 February, regretting his original testy reaction:
“People, to whom it is granted to contribute something to the
progress of science, should not allow pleasure in the fruits of
their common work to be clouded by such matters”
Einstein returned to the relation between inertial mass
and energy in 1906 and in 1907, giving more general arguments for their complete equivalence, but he did not
achieve the complete generality to which he aspired In his
1909 Salzburg talk, Einstein strongly emphasized that inertial mass is a property of all forms of energy, and therefore
118

EINSTEIN ON THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY

electromagnetic radiation must have mass This conclusion
strengthened Einstein’s belief in the hypothesis that light
quanta manifest particle-like properties
In 1905, Einstein proposed a number of other experimentally testable consequences of his theory, in particular the
equations of motion of the electron The following year he
suggested an experimental test of these equations employing
cathode rays11
In this paper, he also mentioned Kaufmann’s experimental
investigations of the motion of electrons in β-rays Starting
in 1901, Kaufmann had carried out a series of experiments
on the deflection of β-rays by electric and magnetic fields In
1905 he asserted that his recent experiments yielded data for
the dependence of mass on velocity that were incompatible
with the (identical) predictions of the Lorentz and Einstein
theories Kaufmann’s work occasioned considerable discussion Lorentz was disheartened by the apparent refutation
of his theory Planck subjected the experiment to a careful
analysis, and concluded that Kaufmann’s work could not be
regarded as a definitive refutation of the Lorentz-Einstein
predictions Röntgen, one of the leading German experimentalists, is reported also to have felt that Kaufmann’s
results were not decisive, because his observations were not
that accurate In a 1907 review, Einstein discussed Kaufmann’s results at some length, especially their apparent
irreconcilability with the Lorentz-Einstein predictions
Commenting on a figure showing Kaufmann’s results and
the relativistic predictions, Einstein wrote: “Considering the
difficulty of the experiment, one might be inclined to regard the agreement as satisfactory” However, he noted that
the deviations were systematic and well outside Kaufmann’s
error limits “Whether the systematic deviations are based
119

PART THREE

upon a source of error not yet considered, or on lack of
correspondence between the foundations of the theory of
relativity and the facts, can only be decided with certainty
when more manifold observational data are at hand”12
Although Einstein evidently accepted experiment as the
ultimate arbiter of the fate of the theory, he was cautious
about accepting Kaufmann’s results as definitive, perhaps
because of his familiarity with Planck’s critical analysis of
the experiments What he found even more difficult to accept were alternative equations of motion for the electron
that are based on what he regarded as arbitrary dynamical
assumptions about the shape of a moving electron While
conceding that Kaufmann’s data seemed to favor the theories of Abraham and Bucherer, Einstein concluded: “In my
opinion, however, a rather small probability should be ascribed to these theories, since their fundamental assumptions about the mass of a moving electron are not supported by theoretical systems that embrace wider complexes
of phenomena”13
This cautious attitude toward Kaufmann’s results proved
justified During the following years, controversies over the
interpretation of the experimental results prevented them
from playing a decisive role in contemporary evaluations of
the theory of relativity Bestelmeyer carried out β-ray experiments generally regarded as inconclusive, while Bucherer’s
results favoring the Lorentz-Einstein equations were seriously questioned Experiments using cathode rays, reported
by several investigators starting in 1910, proved similarly inconclusive Almost a decade elapsed until data supporting
the relativistic predictions (the 1916 results of Guye and
Lavanchy) were generally accepted

On the Electrodynamics
of Moving Bodies

It is well known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at present—when applied to moving bodies,
leads to asymmetries that do not seem to be inherent in the
phenomena Take, for example, the electrodynamic interaction between a magnet and a conductor The observable
phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of
conductor and magnet, whereas the customary view draws a
sharp distinction between the two cases, in which either the
one or the other of the two bodies is in motion For if the
magnet is in motion and the conductor is at rest, an electric field with a definite energy value results in the vicinity
of the magnet that produces a current wherever parts of the
conductor are located But if the magnet is at rest while the
conductor is moving, no electric field results in the vicinity
of the magnet, but rather an electromotive force in the conductor, to which no energy per se corresponds, but which,
assuming an equality of relative motion in the two cases,
gives rise to electric currents of the same magnitude and
123

PAPER 3

the same course as those produced by the electric forces in
the former case
Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to detect a motion of the earth relative to the “light
medium,” lead to the conjecture that not only the phenomena of mechanics but also those of electrodynamics have no
properties that correspond to the concept of absolute rest
Rather, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be
valid1 for all coordinate systems in which the equations of
mechanics hold, as has already been shown for quantities of
the first order We shall raise this conjecture (whose content
will hereafter be called “the principle of relativity”) to the
status of a postulate and shall also introduce another postulate, which is only seemingly incompatible with it, namely
that light always propagates in empty space with a definite
velocity V that is independent of the state of motion of the
emitting body These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent electrodynamics of moving
bodies based on Maxwell’s theory for bodies at rest The introduction of a “light ether” will prove to be superfluous,
inasmuch as the view to be developed here will not require
a “space at absolute rest” endowed with special properties,
nor assign a velocity vector to a point of empty space where
electromagnetic processes are taking place
Like all electrodynamics, the theory to be developed here
is based on the kinematics of a rigid body, since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relations among
rigid bodies (coordinate systems), clocks, and electromagnetic processes Insufficient regard for this circumstance is
at the root of the difficulties with which the electrodynamics
of moving bodies currently has to contend
124

ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES

A Kinematic Part
1 Definition of Simultaneity
Consider a coordinate system in which Newton’s mechanical
equations are valid To distinguish this system verbally from
those to be introduced later, and to make our presentation
more precise, we will call it the “rest system”
If a particle is at rest relative to this coordinate system, its
position relative to the latter can be determined by means
of rigid measuring rods using the methods of Euclidean geometry and expressed in Cartesian coordinates
If we want to describe the motion of a particle, we give
the values of its coordinates as functions of time However,
we must keep in mind that a mathematical description of
this kind only has physical meaning if we are already clear
as to what we understand here by “time” We have to bear
in mind that all our judgments involving time are always
judgments about simultaneous events If, for example, I say
that “the train arrives here at 7 o’clock,” that means, more
or less, “the pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and
the arrival of the train are simultaneous events”1
It might seem that all difficulties involved in the definition
of “time” could be overcome by my substituting “position of
the small hand of my watch” for “time” Such a definition
is indeed sufficient if a time is to be defined exclusively for
the place at which the watch is located; but the definition
is no longer satisfactory when series of events occurring at
different locations have to be linked temporally, or—what
1

We shall not discuss here the imprecision inherent in the concept
of simultaneity of two events taking place at (approximately) the same
location, which can be removed only by an abstraction
125

PAPER 3

amounts to the same thing—when events occurring at places
remote from the clock have to be evaluated temporally
To be sure, we could content ourselves with evaluating the
time of events by stationing an observer with a clock at the
origin of the coordinates who assigns to an event to be evaluated the corresponding position of the hands of the clock
when a light signal from that event reaches him through
empty space However, we know from experience that such
a coordination has the drawback of not being independent
of the position of the observer with the clock We reach a
far more practical arrangement by the following argument
If there is a clock at point A in space, then an observer
located at A can evaluate the time of events in the immediate vicinity of A by finding the positions of the hands of
the clock that are simultaneous with these events If there
is another clock at point B that in all respects resembles the
one at A, then the time of events in the immediate vicinity of B can be evaluated by an observer at B But it is not
possible to compare the time of an event at A with one at
B without a further stipulation So far we have defined only
an “A-time” and a “B-time,” but not a common “time” for A
and B The latter can now be determined by establishing by
definition that the “time” required for light to travel from A
to B is equal to the “time” it requires to travel from B to A
For, suppose a ray of light leaves from A for B at “A-time”
tA , is reflected from B toward A at “B-time” tB , and arrives
back at A at “A-time” tA′  The two clocks are synchronous
by definition if
tB − tA = tA′ − tB 

We assume that it is possible for this definition of synchronism to be free of contradictions, and to be so for arbitrarily
126

ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES

many points, and therefore that the following relations are
generally valid:
1 If the clock at B runs synchronously with the clock at A, the
clock at A runs synchronously with the clock at B
2 If the clock at A runs synchronously with the clock at B as
well as with the clock at C, then the clocks at B and C also
run synchronously relative to each other

By means of certain (imagined) physical experiments, we
have established what is to be understood by synchronous
clocks at rest relative to each other and located at different
places, and thereby obviously arrived at definitions of “synchronous” and “time” The “time” of an event is the reading
obtained simultaneously from a clock at rest that is located
at the place of the event, which for all time determinations
runs synchronously with a specified clock at rest, and indeed
with the specified clock
Based on experience, we further stipulate that the quantity
2 AB = V
tA′ − tA

be a universal constant (the velocity of light in empty space)
It is essential that we have defined time by means of clocks
at rest in the rest system; because the time just defined is
related to the system at rest, we call it “the time of the rest
system”
2 On the Relativity of Lengths and Times
The following considerations are based on the principle of
relativity and the principle of the constancy of the velocity
of light We define these two principles as follows:
127

PAPER 3

1 If two coordinate systems are in uniform parallel translational motion relative to each other, the laws according to
which the states of a physical system change do not depend
on which of the two systems these changes are related to
2 Every light ray moves in the “rest” coordinate system with a
fixed velocity V , independently of whether this ray of light is
emitted by a body at rest or in motion Hence,

the definition given in section 1
velocity =

Take a rigid rod at rest; let its length, measured by a measuring rod that is also at rest, be l Now imagine the axis of
the rod placed along the X-axis of the rest coordinate system, and the rod then set into uniform parallel translational
motion (with velocity v along the X-axis in the direction of
increasing x We now inquire about the length of the moving rod, which we imagine to be ascertained by the following
two operations:
a The observer moves together with the aforementioned measuring rod and the rigid rod to be measured, and measures
the length of the rod by laying out the measuring rod in the
same way as if the rod to be measured, the observer, and the
measuring rod were all at rest
b Using clocks at rest and synchronous in the rest system as
outlined in section 1, the observer determines at which points
of the rest system the beginning and end of the rod to be
measured are located at some given time t The distance between these two points, measured with the rod used before—
but now at rest—is also a length that we can call the “length
of the rod”
128

ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES

According to the principle of relativity, the length determined by operation (a), which we shall call “the length of
the rod in the moving system,” must equal the length l of the
rod at rest
The length determined using operation (b), which we
shall call “the length of the (moving) rod in the rest system,” will be determined on the basis of our two principles,
and we shall find that it differs from l
Current kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths determined by the above two operations are exactly equal to
each other, or, in other words, that at the time t a moving
rigid body is totally replaceable, in geometric respects, by
the same body when it is at rest in a particular position
Further, we imagine the two ends (A and B of the rod
equipped with clocks that are synchronous with the clocks
of the rest system, ie, whose readings always correspond to
the “time of the system at rest” at the locations the clocks
happen to occupy; hence, these clocks are “synchronous in
the rest system”
We further imagine that each clock has an observer comoving with it, and that these observers apply to the two
clocks the criterion for the synchronous rate of two clocks
formulated in section 1 Let a ray of light start out from
A at time2 tA ; it is reflected from B at time tB , and arrives
back at A at time tA′  Taking into account the principle of
the constancy of the velocity of light, we find that
tB − tA =

rAB
V −v

“Time” here means both “time of the system at rest” and “the position
of the hands of the moving clock located at the place in question”

PAPER 3

and
tA′ − tB =

rAB

V +v

where rAB denotes the length of the moving rod, measured
in the rest system Observers co-moving with the rod would
thus find that the two clocks do not run synchronously, while
observers in the system at rest would declare them to be
running synchronously
Thus we see that we cannot ascribe absolute meaning to
the concept of simultaneity; instead, two events that are simultaneous when observed from some particular coordinate
system can no longer be considered simultaneous when observed from a system that is moving relative to that system
3 Theory of Transformations of Coordinate
and Time from the Rest System to a System
in Uniform Translational Motion
Relative to It
Let there be two coordinate systems in the “rest” space, ie,
two systems of three mutually perpendicular rigid material
lines originating from one point Let the X-axes of the two
systems coincide, and their Y - and Z-axes be respectively
parallel Each system shall be supplied with a rigid measuring rod and a number of clocks, and let both measuring rods
and all the clocks of the two systems be exactly alike
Now, put the origin of one of the two systems, say k, in a
state of motion with (constant) velocity v in the direction of
increasing x of the other system K, which remains at rest;
and let this new velocity be imparted to k’s coordinate axes,
its corresponding measuring rod, and its clocks To each time
t of the rest system K, there corresponds a definite location
130

ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES

of the axes of the moving system For reasons of symmetry
we are justified to assume that the motion of k can be such
that at time t (“t” always denotes a time of the rest system)
the axes of the moving system are parallel to the axes of the
rest system
We now imagine space to be measured out from both the
rest system K using the measuring rod at rest, and from the
moving system k using the measuring rod moving along with
it, and that coordinates x, y, z and ξ, η, ζ respectively are
obtained in this way Further, by means of the clocks at rest
in the rest system, and using light signals as described in
section 1, we determine the time t of the rest system for
all the points where there are clocks In a similar manner,
by again applying the method of light signals described in
section 1, we determine the time τ of the moving system,
for all points of this moving system at which there are clocks
at rest relative to this system
To every set of values x, y, z, t which completely determines the place and time of an event in the rest system,
there corresponds a set of values ξ, η, ζ, τ that fixes this
event relative to the system k, and the problem to be solved
now is to find the system of equations that connects these
quantities
First of all, it is clear that these equations must be linear
because of the properties of homogeneity that we attribute
to space and time
If we put x′ = x − vt, then it is clear that a point at rest in
the system k has a definite, time-independent set of values x′ ,
y, z belonging to it We first determine τ as a function of x′ , y,
z, and t To this end, we must express in equations that τ is
in fact the aggregate of readings of clocks at rest in system k,
synchronized according to the rule given in section 1
131

PAPER 3

Suppose that at time τ0 , a light ray is sent from the origin
of the system k along the X-axis to x′ and reflected from
there toward the origin at time τ1 , arriving there at time τ2 ;
we then must have

It should be noted that, instead of the coordinate origin,

all values of x′ , y, z

the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in conjunction with the principle of relativity) light also propagates
with velocity V when measured in the moving system For a

and ϕ is an as yet unknown function of v If no assumptions
are made regarding the initial position of the moving system
and the zero point of τ, then a constant must be added to

Now we have to prove that, measured in the moving system, every light ray propagates with the velocity V , if it does
so, as we have assumed, in the rest system; for we have not
yet proved that the principle of the constancy of the velocity
of light is compatible with the relativity principle
Suppose that at time t = τ = 0 a spherical wave is emitted
from the coordinate origin, which at that time is common to

both systems, and that this wave propagates in the system K
with the velocity V  Hence, if x y z is a point reached by
this wave, we have
x2 + y 2 + z2 = V 2 t 2 

We transform this equation using our transformation
equations and, after a simple calculation, obtain
ξ 2 + η2 + ζ 2 = V 2 τ 2 

Thus, our wave is also a spherical wave with propagation velocity V when it is observed in the moving
system This proves that our two fundamental principles are
compatible3
The transformation equations we have derived also contain an unknown function ϕ of v, which we now wish to
determine
To this end we introduce a third coordinate system K′ ,
which, relative to the system k, is in parallel-translational
motion, parallel to the axis ,4 such that its origin moves
along the -axis with velocity −v Let all three coordinate
origins coincide at time t = 0, and let the time t ′ of system
K′ equal zero at t = x = y = z = 0 We denote the coordinates measured in the system K′ by x′  y ′  z′ and, by twofold

Since the relations between x′  y ′  z′ and x y z do not
contain the time t, the systems K and K′ are at rest relative
to each other, and it is clear that the transformation from K
to K′ must be the identity transformation Hence,
ϕvϕ−v = 1

Let us now explore the meaning of ϕv We shall focus on
that portion of the H-axis of the system k that lies between
ξ = 0, η = 0, ζ = 0, and ξ = 0, η = l, ζ = 0 This portion
of the H-axis is a rod that, relative to the system K, moves
perpendicular to its axis with a velocity v and its ends have
coordinates in K:
l 
ϕv

x1 = vt

y1 =

x2 = vt

y2 = 0

z1 = 0

and
z2 = 0

The length of the rod, measured in K, is thus l/ϕv; this
gives us the meaning of the function ϕ For reasons of symmetry, it is now evident that the length of a rod measured in
the rest system and moving perpendicular to its axis can depend only on its velocity and not on the direction and sense
of its motion Thus, the length of the moving rod measured
in the rest system does not change if v is replaced by −v
From this we conclude:
l 
l =
ϕv
ϕ−v

or
ϕv = ϕ−v

From this relation and the one found earlier it follows that

4 The Physical Meaning of the Equations
Obtained as Concerns Moving Rigid Bodies
and Moving Clocks
We consider a rigid sphere3 of radius R that is at rest relative
to the moving system k and whose center lies at the origin of
k The equation of the surface of this sphere, which moves
with velocity v relative to the system k, is
ξ2 + η2 + ζ 2 = R2 

Expressed in terms of x, y, z, the equation of this surface at
time t = 0 is

 2
v  R R
V

Thus, while the Y and Z dimensions of the sphere (and
hence also of every rigid body, whatever its shape) do not
appear to be altered by motion, the X dimension appears to
be contracted in the ratio 1  1 − v/V 2 , thus the greater
the value of v, the greater the contraction For v = V , all
moving objects—considered from the “rest” system—shrink
into plane structures For superluminal velocities our considerations become meaningless; as we shall see from later
considerations, in our theory the velocity of light physically
plays the role of infinitely great velocities
It is clear that the same results apply for bodies at rest in
the “rest” system when considered from a uniformly moving
system
We further imagine one of the clocks that is able to indicate time t when at rest relative to the rest system and time
τ when at rest relative to the moving system to be placed
at the origin of k and set such that it indicates the time τ
What is the rate of this clock when considered from the rest
system?
The quantities x, t, and τ that refer to the position of this
clock obviously satisfy the equations

We thus have

from which it follows that the reading of the clock considered from the rest system lags behind each second by
1 − 1 − v/V 2  sec or, up to quantities of the fourth and
higher order, by 21 v/V 2 sec
This yields the following peculiar consequence: If at the
points A and B of K there are clocks at rest that, considered
from the rest system, are running synchronously, and if the
clock at A is transported to B along the connecting line with
velocity v, then upon arrival of this clock at B the two clocks
will no longer be running synchronously; instead, the clock
that has been transported from A to B will lag 12 tv2 /V 2 sec
(up to quantities of the fourth and higher orders) behind
the clock that has been in B from the outset, where t is the
time needed by the clock to travel from A to B
We see at once that this result holds even when the clock
moves from A to B along any arbitrary polygonal line, and
even when the points A and B coincide5
If we assume that the result proved for a polygonal line
holds also for a continuously curved line, then we arrive
at the following result: If there are two synchronously running clocks at A, and one of them is moved along a closed
curve with constant velocity until it has returned to A, which
takes, say, t sec, then, on its arrival at A, this clock will lag

2 tv/V  sec behind the clock that has not been moved
From this we conclude that a balance-wheel clock6 located
at the Earth’s equator must, under otherwise identical conditions, run more slowly by a very small amount than an
absolutely identical clock located at one of the Earth’s poles

5 The Addition Theorem for Velocities
In the system k moving with velocity v along the X-axis
of the system K, let a point move in accordance with the
equations
ξ = wξ τ
η = wη τ
ζ = 0

where wξ and wη denote constants
We seek the motion of the point relative to the system K
Introducing the quantities x, y, z, t into the equations of motion of the point by means of the transformation equations
derived in section 3, we obtain

α is then to be considered as the angle between the velocities v and w After a simple calculation we obtain

It is worth noting that v and w enter into the expression for
the resultant velocity in a symmetrical manner If w also has
the direction of the X-axis -axis), we get
U =

v+w

1 + vw2
V

It follows from this equation that the composition of two
velocities that are smaller than V always results in a velocity
that is smaller than V  For if we set v = V − κ, and w =
V − λ, where κ and λ are positive and smaller than V , then
U =V

2V − κ − λ
< V
2V − κ − λ + κλ
V

It also follows that the velocity of light V cannot be
changed by compounding it with a “subluminal velocity”
For this case we get
U =

V +w
= V
1+ w
V

In the case where v and w have the same direction, the formula for U could also have been obtained by compounding
two transformations according to section 3 If in addition to
the systems K and k, occurring in section 3, we introduce
a third coordinate system k′ , which moves parallel to k and
whose origin moves with velocity w along the -axis, we
obtain equations between the quantities x, y, z, t and the
141

PAPER 3

corresponding quantities of k′ that differ from those found
in section 3 only insofar as “v" is replaced by the quantity

from this we see that such parallel transformations form a
group—as indeed they must
We have now derived the required laws of the kinematics
corresponding to our two principles, and proceed to their
application to electrodynamics

The relativity principle requires that the Maxwell-Hertz
equations for empty space also be valid in the system k if
they are valid in the system K, ie, that the electric and
magnetic force vectors—X′  Y ′  Z′  and L′  M ′  N ′ —of the
moving system k, which are defined in this system by their
ponderomotive effects on electric and magnetic charges,
respectively, satisfy the equations

Obviously, the two systems of equations found for the system k must express exactly the same thing, since both systems
of equations are equivalent to the Maxwell-Hertz equations
for the system K Further, since the equations for the two systems are in agreement apart from the symbols representing
the vectors, it follows that the functions occurring in the systems of equations at corresponding places must agree up to
a factor ψv, common to all functions of one of the systems
of equations and independent of ξ, η, ζ, and τ, but possibly
depending on v Thus we have the relations:
X′ = ψvX

If we now invert this system of equations, first by solving
the equations just obtained, and second by applying to the
equations the inverse transformation (from k to K), which is
characterized by the velocity −v, we get, taking into account
that both systems of equations so obtained must be identical,
ϕv · ϕ−v = 1

Further, it follows for reasons of symmetry4 that
ϕv = ϕ−v
4

If, eg, X = Y = Z = L = M = 0 and N = 0, then it is clear for reasons of symmetry that if v changes its sign without changing its numerical
value, then Y ′ must also change its sign without changing its numerical
value

thus

By way of interpreting these equations, we note the following
remarks: Imagine a pointlike electric charge, whose magnitude measured in the rest system is “unit,” ie, which, when
at rest in the rest system exerts a force of 1 dyne on an equal
charge at a distance of 1 cm According to the principle of
relativity this electric charge is also of “unit” magnitude if
measured in the moving system If this electric charge is at
rest relative to the rest system, then by definition the vector X Y  Z equals the force acting on it If, on the other
hand, this acting charge is at rest relative to the moving system (at least at the relevant instant), then the force acting
on it measured in the moving system is equal to the vector
X′  Y ′  Z′  Hence, the first three of the above equations can
be expressed in words in the following two ways:
1 If a unit point electric charge moves in an electromagnetic
field, there acts upon it, in addition to the electric force,
an “electromotive force” that, neglecting terms multiplied by
the second and higher powers of v/V , is equal to the vector
product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force,
divided by the velocity of light (Old mode of expression)
2 If a unit point electric charge moves in an electromagnetic
field, the force acting on it equals the electric force at the
145

PAPER 3

location of the unit charge that is obtained by transforming
the field to a coordinate system at rest relative to the unit
charge (New mode of expression)

Analogous remarks hold for “magnetomotive forces”8
We can see that in the theory developed here, the electromotive force only plays the role of an auxiliary concept,
which owes its introduction to the circumstance that the
electric and magnetic forces do not have an existence independent of the state of motion of the coordinate system
It is further clear that the asymmetry in the treatment
of currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet
and a conductor, mentioned in the introduction, disappears
Moreover, questions about the “site” of electrodynamic electromotive forces (unipolar machines) become pointless
7 Theory of Doppler’s Principle and of Aberration

of light of frequency ν, in such a way that the connecting line
“light source–observer” forms an angle ϕ with the observer’s
velocity, where this velocity is relative to a coordinate system

A′2 /A2 would be the ratio of the energy of a given light

the volume of a light complex were the same measured in

All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved
by the method employed here The essential point is that
the electric and magnetic fields of light that is influenced by
a moving body are transformed to a coordinate system that
is at rest relative to that body By this means, all problems
in the optics of moving bodies are reduced to a series of
problems in the optics of bodies at rest

Since—as follows from the velocity addition theorem (sec
5)—the vector uξ  uη  uζ  is actually the velocity of the electric charges measured in the system k, we have thus shown
that, on the basis of our kinematic principles, the electrodynamic foundation of Lorentz’s theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies agrees with the principle of relativity
Let me also briefly add that the following important proposition can easily be deduced from the equations we have
derived: If an electrically charged body moves arbitrarily in
space without altering its charge when observed from a coordinate system moving with the body, then its charge also
remains constant when observed from the “rest” system K
10 Dynamics of the (Slowly Accelerated) Electron
In an electromagnetic field let there move an electrically
charged particle with charge ǫ (called an “electron” in what
follows); we assume only the following about its law of
motion:
154

ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES

If the electron is at rest at a particular moment, its motion
during the next instant of time will occur according to the
equations

where x y z denote the coordinates of the electron and µ
its mass as long as the electron moves slowly
Further, let the electron’s velocity at a certain moment be
v We investigate the law of motion of the electron during
the immediately succeeding instant of time
Without loss of generality, we may and shall assume that
the electron is at the coordinate origin and moves with velocity v along the X-axis of the system K at the moment with
which we are concerned It is then obvious that at the given
moment t = 0, the electron is at rest relative to a coordinate system k moving with constant velocity v parallel to the
X-axis
From the above assumption combined with the relativity
principle, it is clear that, considered from the system k, the
electron will move during the immediately ensuing period
of time (for small values of t according to the equations

where the symbols ξ, η, ζ, τ, X′ , Y ′ , Z′ all refer to the

and note first that ǫX′ , ǫY ′ , ǫZ′ are the components of the
ponderomotive force acting on the electron, as considered in
a moving system that, at this instant, is moving with the same
velocity as the electron (This force could be measured, for
example, by a spring balance at rest in the latter system) If
we simply call13 this force “the force acting on the electron,”
and preserve the equation
Mass × Acceleration = Force,

stipulating, in addition, that accelerations be measured in
the rest system K, then the above equations lead to the
definition:

Transverse mass =

Longitudinal mass = 

Of course, with a different definition of force and acceleration we would obtain different values for these masses;
this shows that we must proceed very cautiously when comparing various theories of electron motion
It should be noted that these results about mass are also
valid for ponderable material points, because a ponderable
material point can be made into an electron (in our sense
of the word) by adding to it an arbitrarily small electric
charge
We now determine the kinetic energy of an electron If
an electron starts from the origin of the system K with an
initial velocity 0 and continues to move along the X-axis
under the influence of an electrostatic force X, it is clear that
the energy it takes from the electrostatic field has the value
157

PAPER 3



ǫXdx Since the electron is supposed to accelerate slowly,
and consequently cannot emit any energy in the form of
radiation, the energy taken from the electrostatic field must
be equated to the kinetic energy W of the electron Bearing
in mind that the first of equations (A) holds throughout the
entire process of motion, we obtain
W =

Thus, W becomes infinitely large when v = V  As is the
case for our previous results, superluminal velocities are not
possible
By virtue of the argument presented above, this expression for kinetic energy must also be valid for ponderable
masses
Let us now enumerate the properties of the electron’s
motion resulting from the system of equations (A) that are
accessible to experiment
1 From the second equation of the system (A) it follows
that an electric force Y and a magnetic force N have an
equally strong deflective effect on an electron moving with
velocity v if Y = Nv/V  Thus we see that, using our theory, it
is possible to determine the velocity of the electron from the
ratio of the magnetic deflection Am to the electric deflection
Ae for arbitrary velocities, by applying the law
Am

This relation can be tested experimentally since the velocity of the electron can also be measured directly, eg, using
rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic fields

electron and the velocity v that the electron acquires must

Does the Inertia of a Body
Depend on Its Energy Content?

The results of an electrodynamic investigation recently
published by me in this journal1 lead to a very interesting
conclusion, which will be derived here
I based that investigation on the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space, together with Maxwell’s expression for
the electromagnetic energy of space, and also the following
principle:
The laws according to which the states of physical systems
change are independent of which one of the two coordinate
systems (assumed to be in uniform parallel-translational motion relative to each other) is used to describe these changes
(the principle of relativity)
Based on this foundation,2 I derived the following result,
among others (loc cit, sec 8)

From this equation one immediately concludes:
If a body emits the energy L in the form of radiation, its
mass decreases by L/V 2  Here it is obviously inessential that
the energy taken from the body turns into radiant energy,
so we are led to the more general conclusion:
The mass of a body is a measure of its energy content;
if the energy changes by L, the mass changes in the same
sense by L/9 · 1020 if the energy is measured in ergs and the
mass in grams
It is not excluded that it will prove possible to test this
theory using bodies whose energy content is variable to a
high degree (eg, radium salts)
If the theory agrees with the facts, then radiation carries
inertia between emitting and absorbing bodies

Einstein’s Early Work on the
Quantum Hypothesis



Einstein in Bern, ca 1905 (Lotte Jacobi
Archives, University of New Hampshire)

In describing his 1905 papers, Einstein characterized only
paper 5 as revolutionary (see the Introduction, p 5) It is
still regarded as revolutionary for challenging the unlimited validity of Maxwell’s theory of light and suggesting the
existence of light quanta Paper 5 shows that, at a sufficiently high frequency, the entropy of equilibrium thermal
(or “black-body”) radiation behaves as if the radiation consisted of a gas of independent “quanta of light energy” (or
simply “light quanta”), each with energy proportional to the
frequency of the corresponding wave Einstein showed how
to explain several otherwise puzzling phenomena by assuming that the interaction of light with matter consists of the
emission or absorption of such light quanta
Einstein became familiar with black-body radiation well
before 1905 Mach’s Wärmelehre, which Einstein read in
1897 or shortly thereafter, contains two chapters on thermal radiation, culminating in a discussion of Gustav Robert
Kirchhoff’s work Kirchhoff showed that the energy emission spectrum of a perfectly black body (defined as one that
absorbs all incident radiation) at a given temperature is a
universal function of the temperature of the body and wavelength of the radiation He inferred that equilibrium thermal
radiation in a cavity with walls maintained at a certain temperature behaves like radiation emitted by a black body at
the same temperature
Heinrich Friedrich Weber, Einstein’s physics professor at
the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), was one
of those who attempted to determine the universal blackbody radiation function He made measurements of the energy spectrum and proposed an empirical formula for the
167

PART FOUR

distribution function He showed that, as a consequence of
his formula, λm = constant/T (where λm is the wavelength
with the maximum intensity of the distribution), thus anticipating Wilhelm Wien’s formulation of the displacement
law for black-body radiation Weber described his work in
a course at the ETH given during the winter semester of
1898–1899, which Einstein took
Einstein soon started to think seriously about the problem
of radiation By the spring of 1901, he was closely following
Planck’s work on black-body radiation Originally, Planck had
hoped to explain the irreversibility of physical processes by
studying electromagnetic radiation; ultimately, he came to
recognize that this could not be done without introducing
statistical elements into the argument In a series of papers
between 1897 and 1900, Planck utilized Maxwell’s electrodynamics to develop a theory of thermal radiation in interaction with one or more identical, charged harmonic oscillators within a cavity He was only able to account for the
radiation’s irreversible approach to thermal equilibrium by
employing methods analogous to those that Ludwig Boltzmann had used in kinetic theory Planck introduced the notion of “natural” (that is, maximally disordered) radiation,
which he defined by analogy with Boltzmann’s definition of
molecular chaos Using Maxwell’s theory, Planck derived a
relation between the average energy Ē of a charged oscillator of frequency ν in equilibrium with thermal radiation
and the energy density per unit frequency interval ρν of the
radiation at the same frequency:
Ēν =

c3 ρ 
8πν2 ν

where c is the speed of light
168

(1)

EARLY WORK ON QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS

Planck calculated the average energy of an oscillator by
making assumptions about the entropy of the oscillators that
enabled him to derive Wien’s law for the energy density
of the black-body spectrum, which originally seemed well
supported by the experimental evidence But by the turn of
the century new observations showed systematic deviations
from Wien’s law for large values of λT 
Planck presented a new energy density distribution formula that agreed closely with observations over the entire
spectrum:1
3
1
ρν = 8πhν

3
c
ehν/kT − 1

(2)

In this expression, now known as Planck’s law or Planck’s
formula, k = R/N is Boltzmann’s constant, where R is the
gas constant, N is Avogadro’s (or Loschmidt’s) number, and
h is a new constant (later called Planck’s constant) To derive this formula, Planck calculated the entropy of the oscillators, using what Einstein later called “the Boltzmann
principle”: S = k ln W  where S is the entropy of a macroscopic state of the system, the probability of which is W 
Following Boltzmann, Planck took the probability of a state
to be proportional to the number of “complexions,” or possible microconfigurations of the system corresponding to that
state He calculated this number by dividing the total energy of the state into a finite number of elements of equal
magnitude, and counting the number of possible ways of
distributing these energy elements among the individual oscillators If the size of the energy elements is set equal to
hν, where ν is the frequency of an oscillator, an expression
for the entropy of an oscillator results that leads to eq (2)
Although Einstein expressed private misgivings about
Planck’s approach in 1901, he did not mention Planck or
169

PART FOUR

black-body radiation in his papers until 1904 A study of the
foundations of statistical physics, which he undertook between 1902 and 1904, provided Einstein with the tools he
needed to analyze Planck’s derivation and explore its consequences At least three elements of Einstein’s “general
molecular theory of heat” were central to his subsequent
work on the quantum hypothesis: (1) the introduction of
the canonical ensemble; (2) the interpretation of probability
as it occurs in Boltzmann’s principle; and (3) the study of
energy fluctuations in thermal equilibrium
1 In an analysis of the canonical ensemble, Einstein
proved that the equipartition theorem (see the Introduction, p 16) holds for any system in thermal equilibrium
In paper 5 he showed that, when applied to an ensemble of charged harmonic oscillators in equilibrium with
thermal radiation, the equipartition theorem leads, via eq
(1), to a black-body distribution law now known as the
Rayleigh-Jeans law:
2

kT 
ρν = 8πν
c3

(3)

Despite its rigorous foundation in classical physics, eq (3)
only agrees with the observed energy distribution for small
values of ν/T ; indeed, as Einstein noted, it implies an infinite total radiant energy
2 In 1906, Einstein posed a question that preoccupied
him and others at the time: “How is it that Planck did not
arrive at the same formula [eq (3)], but at the expression   
[eq (2)]?” One answer lies in Planck’s definition of W in
Boltzmann’s principle, which, as Einstein repeatedly noted,
differs fundamentally from his own definition of probabilities
as time averages As noted above, Planck interpreted W as
170

EARLY WORK ON QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS

proportional to the number of complexions of a state of the
system As Einstein pointed out in 1909, such a definition
of W is equivalent to its definition as the average, over a
long period of time, of the fraction of time that the system
spends in this state only if all complexions corresponding
to a given total energy are equally probable However, if
this is assumed to hold for an ensemble of oscillators in
thermal equilibrium with radiation, the Rayleigh-Jeans law
results Hence, the validity of Planck’s law implies that all
complexions cannot be equally probable Einstein showed
that, if the energies available to a canonical ensemble of
oscillators are arbitrarily restricted to multiples of the energy
element hν, then all possible complexions are not equally
probable, and Planck’s law results
3 A third element of Einstein’s work on statistical physics
that is central to his work on the quantum hypothesis is his
method for calculating mean-square fluctuations in the state
variables of a system in thermal equilibrium He employed
the canonical ensemble to calculate such fluctuations in the
energy of mechanical systems, then boldly applied the result
to a nonmechanical system—black-body radiation, deducing
a relation that agrees with Wien’s displacement law discussed
above This agreement suggests the applicability of statistical
concepts to radiation, and may have suggested to Einstein
the possibility that radiation could be treated as a system
with a finite number of degrees of freedom, a possibility he
raised at the outset of paper 5
In connection with his work on Brownian motion in 1905–
1906, Einstein developed additional methods for calculating fluctuations, methods he later applied to the analysis of
black-body radiation In particular, he developed a method
based on an inversion of Boltzmann’s principle that can be
171

PART FOUR

used even in the absence of a microscopic model of the
system If the entropy of a system is given as a function
of its macroscopic state variables, then Boltzmann’s principle, in the form W = exp S/k , can be used to calculate
the probability of a state, and hence of fluctuations of any
state variable In 1909, Einstein used this method to calculate the fluctuations in the energy of black-body radiation
in a given region of space The stochastic method, used in
the same paper to calculate fluctuations in the pressure of
radiation, is based on his work on Brownian motion Pressure fluctuations maintain the Brownian motion of a small
mirror moving through the radiation field, in the face of the
retarding force exerted on the mirror by the average radiation pressure The results of these fluctuation calculations
are discussed below
Einstein’s work on relativity also contributed to the development of his views on the nature of light By eliminating
the concept of the ether and showing that a flux of radiant energy transfers inertial mass, the theory of relativity
demonstrated that light no longer need be treated as a disturbance in a hypothetical medium, but could be regarded
as composed of independent structures, to which mass must
be attributed
Among Einstein’s papers on the quantum hypothesis, paper
5 is unique in arguing for the notion of light quanta without using either the formal apparatus of his statistical papers
or Planck’s law As noted above, Einstein demonstrated that
only the Rayleigh-Jeans law, the limiting form of Planck’s
formula for small values of ν/T  is consistent with classical statistical mechanics and Maxwell’s electrodynamics At
the other extreme, at which Wien’s distribution law holds,
172

EARLY WORK ON QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS

Einstein argues that “theoretical principles we have been
using    fail completely” As he explained later that year,
this failure “seems to me to have its basis in a fundamental
incompleteness of our physical concepts”2
Einstein opened the paper by pointing out the “profound
formal difference” between current theories of matter, in
which the energy of a body is represented as a sum over a
finite number of degrees of freedom, and Maxwell’s theory, in which the energy is a continuous spatial function
of fields having an infinite number of degrees of freedom
He suggested that the inability of Maxwell’s theory to give
an adequate account of radiation might be remedied by a
theory in which radiant energy is distributed discontinuously in space Einstein formulated “the light quantum hypothesis” that “when a light ray spreads out from a point
source, the energy is not distributed continuously over an
ever-increasing volume but consists of a finite number of
energy quanta that are localized at points in space, move
without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated only as
complete units”
Using Wien’s law, Einstein showed that the expression
for the volume dependence of the entropy of radiation at
a given frequency is similar in form to that of the entropy
of an ideal gas He concluded that “monochromatic radiation of low density (within the range of validity of Wien’s
radiation formula) behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta of magnitude
Rβν/N ”
In addition to its contributions to theory, paper 5 also
provides ingenious explanations of several observed phenomena It examines three interactions of light with matter,
treated “as if light consisted of such energy quanta”: Stokes’s
173

PART FOUR

rule for fluorescence; the ionization of gases by ultraviolet
light; and the photoelectric effect Einstein proposed what
later became known as his photoelectric equation,
Emax = R/N βν − P 

(4)

where Emax is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, Rβ/N is equivalent to Planck’s h, ν is the frequency
of the incident radiation, and P is the work function of the
metal emitting the electrons Although his derivation of this
equation was later considered to be a leading achievement
of that paper—it is cited in his 1922 Nobel Prize award—for
almost two decades this argument failed to persuade most
physicists of the validity of the light quantum hypothesis
Philip Lenard’s experimental studies, to which Einstein referred, only provide qualitative evidence for an increase of
Emax with frequency For almost a decade the quantitative relationship between electron energy and radiation frequency
was in doubt By about 1914, there was a substantial body of
evidence tending to support eq (4) Robert Millikan’s 1916
studies clinched the case for almost all physicists But even
the confirmation of Einstein’s photoelectric equation did not
bring about widespread acceptance of the concept of light
quanta Alternative interpretations of the photoelectric effect still received general support for a number of years
The earliest widely accepted empirical evidence for the
quantum hypothesis came not from radiation phenomena,
but from data on specific heats of solids In 1907, Einstein
applied the quantum hypothesis to the model of a solid
as a lattice of atoms harmonically bound to their equilibrium positions3 When the oscillators are treated classically,
the equipartition theorem leads to the DuLong-Petit rule,
174

EARLY WORK ON QUANTUM HYPOTHESIS

predicting a constant specific heat for solids at all temperatures Treating each atom as a quantized three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, Einstein was able to explain the wellknown anomalous decrease of the specific heats of certain
solids with decreasing temperature, and to obtain a relation
between the specific heat of a solid and its selective absorption of infrared radiation
Einstein had long suspected the existence of such a connection Perhaps inspired by Planck’s work, in 1901 Einstein
wondered whether the internal kinetic energy of solids and
liquids could be conceived of as “the energy of electric resonators” If it could, then the “specific heat and absorption
spectrum of bodies must then be related”4 He tried to
connect this model with deviations from the DuLong-Petit
rule
In 1907 Einstein avoided the implications of the equipartition theorem for the specific heats of solids as he had
avoided them for radiation theory, by introducing energy
quanta From the average energy of a quantized oscillator, Einstein derived an expression for the specific heat of
a monatomic solid as a function of βT /ν The expression
approaches zero with the temperature, and approaches the
DuLong-Petit value at high temperatures Considering the
simplified nature of the model, the expression is in fairly
good agreement with Weber’s data on diamond
A connection could also be made with absorption results
from Drude’s optical dispersion theory Drude showed that
the infrared optical eigenfrequencies of a solid are due to
vibrations of the lattice ions, while the electrons are responsible for the ultraviolet eigenfrequencies At room temperature, the value of Einstein’s expression for specific heat effectively vanishes at a frequency well within the infrared

region for most solids, and increases to the DuLong-Petit
value for even lower frequencies Einstein concluded that
only the lattice ions and atoms contribute to the specific
heats of solids Moreover, if a solid displays infrared absorption resonances, the temperature dependence of its specific
heat can be determined from these resonant frequencies
In 1910 Nernst and his assistant Frederick A Lindemann
obtained general agreement between Einstein’s predictions
and observations of the variation with temperature of the
specific heat of a number of solids In 1911 Nernst reported
the first confirmation of the quantum hypothesis outside the
field of radiation, observing: “That the observations in their
totality provide a brilliant confirmation of the quantum theory of Planck and Einstein is obvious”5

On a Heuristic Point of View
Concerning the Production and
Transformation of Light

A profound formal difference exists between the theoretical concepts that physicists have formed about gases
and other ponderable bodies, and Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic processes in so-called empty space While we
consider the state of a body to be completely determined
by the positions and velocities of an indeed very large yet
finite number of atoms and electrons, we make use of continuous spatial functions to determine the electromagnetic
state of a volume of space, so that a finite number of quantities cannot be considered as sufficient for the complete
determination of the electromagnetic state of space According to Maxwell’s theory, energy is considered to be a
continuous spatial function for all purely electromagnetic
phenomena, hence also for light, whereas according to the
present view of physicists, the energy of a ponderable body
should be represented as a sum over the atoms and electrons The energy of a ponderable body cannot be broken
177

PAPER 5

up into arbitrarily many, arbitrarily small parts, but according to Maxwell’s theory (or, more generally, according to any
wave theory) the energy of a light ray emitted from a point
source continuously spreads out over an ever-increasing
volume
The wave theory of light, which operates with continuous spatial functions, has proved itself superbly in describing purely optical phenomena and will probably never be
replaced by another theory One should keep in mind, however, that optical observations refer to time averages rather
than instantaneous values; and it is quite conceivable, despite the complete confirmation of the theory of diffraction,
reflection, refraction, dispersion, etc, by experiment, that
the theory of light, operating with continuous spatial functions, leads to contradictions when applied to the phenomena of emission and transformation of light
Indeed, it seems to me that the observations of “blackbody radiation,” photoluminescence, production of cathode
rays by ultraviolet light, and other related phenomena associated with the emission or transformation of light appear
more readily understood if one assumes that the energy of
light is discontinuously distributed in space According to the
assumption considered here, in the propagation of a light ray
emitted from a point source, the energy is not distributed
continuously over ever-increasing volumes of space, but consists of a finite number of energy quanta localized at points
of space that move without dividing, and can be absorbed
or generated only as complete units
In this paper I wish to present the train of thought and
cite the facts that led me onto this path, in the hope that
the approach to be presented will prove of use to some researchers in their investigations
178

PRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF LIGHT

1 On a Difficulty Concerning
the Theory of
“Black-Body Radiation”
We shall begin by considering the following case from the
perspective of Maxwell’s theory and electron theory Let a
space enclosed by completely reflecting walls contain a number of freely moving gas molecules and electrons that exert conservative forces on each other when they come very
close, ie, can collide with each other like molecules according to the kinetic theory of gases1 Suppose, further, that a
number of electrons are bound to widely separated points
in space by forces directed toward these points and proportional to their distances from them The bound electrons also
enter into conservative interactions with the free molecules
and electrons when the latter come very close We call the
bound electrons “resonators”; they emit and absorb electromagnetic waves of definite periods
According to the present view concerning the origin of
light, the radiation in the volume we are considering, as is
found for the case of dynamic equilibrium based on Maxwell’s theory, must be identical with “black-body radiation”—
at least if one assumes that resonators of all relevant frequencies are present
For the time being, we will disregard the radiation emitted and absorbed by the resonators and investigate the condition of dynamic equilibrium corresponding to the interac1
This assumption is equivalent to the supposition that the mean kinetic
energies of gas molecules and electrons are equal to each other at thermal
equilibrium As is well known, Mr Drude used the latter assumption
to derive a theoretical expression for the ratio of thermal and electrical
conductivities of metals

179

PAPER 5

tion (collisions between) molecules and electrons For such
an equilibrium, the kinetic theory of gases asserts that the
mean kinetic energy of a resonator electron must be equal
to the mean translational kinetic energy of a gas molecule If
we decompose the motion of a resonator electron into three
mutually perpendicular oscillatory motions, we find for the
mean value Ē of the energy of one such linear oscillatory
motion
Ē = R T 
N

where R denotes the universal gas constant, N the number
of “real molecules”1 in one gram-equivalent, and T the
absolute temperature Because of the equality of the time
averages of the resonator’s kinetic and potential energies, the
energy Ē is two-thirds the kinetic energy of a free monatomic gas molecule If due to some cause—in our case,
radiation processes—the energy of a resonator were to have
a time average greater or less than Ē, then collisions with
the free electrons and molecules would lead to an energy
loss to or a gain from the gas, different on the average from
zero Thus, in the case we are considering, dynamic equilibrium is possible only if the average energy of each resonator
is Ē
We will now apply a similar argument to the interaction
between the resonators and the radiation present in space
Mr Planck has derived the condition for dynamic equilibrium in this case2 on the assumption that the radiation can
be treated as the most completely conceivable disordered

Ēν = L 2 ρν 

Ēν is here the mean energy of a resonator with eigenfrequency ν (per unit frequency interval), L is the velocity of
light, ν the frequency, and ρν dν the energy per unit volume
of that part of the radiation whose frequency lies between ν
and ν + dν
3

This assumption can be formulated as follows We expand the Zcomponent of the electrical force Z at an arbitrary point of the space
being considered during the time interval between t = 0 and t = T
(where T denotes a time period very large relative to all relevant oscillation periods) in a Fourier series,
Z=

where Aν ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ αν ≤ 2π If one imagines that at the same point
of space such an expansion is made arbitrarily often at randomly chosen starting times, then one will obtain different sets of values for the
quantities Aν and αν  For the frequency of occurrence of the various
combinations of values of the quantities Aν and αν , there will then exist
(statistical) probabilities dW of the form
dW = f A1 A2    α1 α2    dA1 dA2    dα1 dα2   
The radiation is then most conceivably disordered if
f A1  A2    α1  α2    = F1 A1 F2 A2    f1 α1 · f2 α2    
ie, when the probability of a specific value of one of the quantities A or
x2 is independent of the values taken by the other quantities A and α respectively Hence, the more closely fulfilled the condition is that individual
pairs of quantities Aν and αν depend on the emission and absorption processes of particular groups of resonators, the more closely can radiation
in our case be considered to be “most conceivably disordered”
181

not continually decrease or increase, the following relations

These relations, found as the conditions of dynamic equilibrium, not only fail to agree with experiment but also imply

the total radiation energy of the volume, and in the limit we

2 On Planck’s Determination of
the Elementary Quanta4
We now wish to show that Mr Planck’s determination of the
elementary quanta is to a certain extent independent of his
theory of “black-body radiation”
Planck’s formula4 for ρν , which is satisfied by all experiments up to now, reads

where
α = 610 × 10−56
β = 4866 × 10−11 

For large values of T /ν, ie, for high wavelengths and radiation densities, this equation takes the following limiting
form:
ρν = α ν2 T 
β

One can see that this formula agrees with that derived in
section 1 from Maxwell’s theory and electron theory By
equating the coefficients of the two formulas, we obtain
R 8π = α

N =

α L3

ie, one atom of hydrogen weighs 1/N gram = 162 ×
10−24 g This is exactly the value found by Mr Planck,
which in turn is in satisfactory agreement with the values
found by other methods
We therefore arrive at the following conclusion: the higher
the energy density and wavelength of radiation, the more
reasonable the theoretical foundations we have been using
prove to be; however, they fail completely in the case of low
wavelengths and low radiation densities
In the following, we shall consider “black-body radiation”
together with the experimental facts, without establishing
any model for the emission and propagation of radiation
183

PAPER 5

3 On the Entropy of Radiation
The following treatment is contained in a well-known study
by Mr Wien and is presented here only for the sake of
completeness
Consider radiation occupying a volume v We assume that
the observable properties of this radiation are completely
determined when the radiation density ρ ν is given for all
frequencies5 Since radiations of different frequencies can
be regarded as separable from each other without performing any work or transferring any heat, the entropy of the
radiation can be represented by
∞

S=v

0

ϕ ρ ν dν

where ϕ is a function of the variables ρ and ν One can
reduce ϕ to a function of a single variable by asserting that
adiabatic compression of radiation between reflecting walls
does not change its entropy However, we shall not pursue
this, but will immediately investigate how the function ϕ can
be obtained from the black-body radiation law
In the case of “black-body radiation,” ρ is such a function
of ν that the entropy is a maximum for a given energy, ie,
δ

ϕ ρ ν dν = 0

ρ dν = 0

This assumption is arbitrary We shall naturally keep this simplest assumption as long as experiment does not force us to abandon it

From this it follows that for every choice of δρ as a function
of ν,

where λ is independent of ν Thus, for black-body radiation,

The following equation applies when the temperature of
black-body radiation of volume v = 1 increases by dT :

or, since ∂ϕ/∂ρ is independent of ν,

Since dE is equal to the heat added and the process is reversible, we also have
dS = 1 dE

This is the law of black-body radiation Thus, one can derive
the law of black-body radiation from the function ϕ, and,
inversely, the function ϕ can be determined by integration,
remembering that ϕ vanishes for ρ = 0

186

PRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF LIGHT

This equation shows that the entropy of monochromatic
radiation of sufficiently low density varies with the volume
according to the same law as the entropy of an ideal gas or a
dilute solution In the following, we shall interpret this equation on the basis of the principle introduced into physics by
Mr Boltzmann, according to which the entropy of a system
is a function of the probability of its state

5 Molecular-Theoretical Investigation
of the Dependence on Volume of the Entropy
of Gases and Dilute Solutions
In calculating entropy by molecular-theoretical methods, the
word “probability” is often used in a sense differing from
the way the word is defined in probability theory In particular, “cases of equal probability” are often hypothetically
stipulated when the theoretical models employed are definite enough to permit a deduction rather than a stipulation
I will show in a separate paper that, in dealing with thermal processes, it suffices completely to use the so-called statistical probability, and hope thereby to eliminate a logical
difficulty that still obstructs the application of Boltzmann’s
principle Here, however, I shall give only its general formulation and its application to very special cases
If it is meaningful to talk about the probability of a state
of a system, and if, furthermore, each increase of entropy
can be conceived as a transition to a state of higher probability, then the entropy S1 of a system is a function of the
probability W1 of its instantaneous state Therefore, if we
have two systems S1 and S2 that do not interact with each
187

PAPER 5

other, we can set:
S1 = ϕ1 W1 
S2 = ϕ2 W2 

If these two systems are viewed as a single system of entropy
S and probability W , then
S = S1 + S2 = ϕ W

and
W = W1 · W2 

The last equation tells us that the states of the two systems
are events that are independent of each other
From these equations it follows that
ϕ W1 · W2 = ϕ1 W1 + ϕ2 W2 

and, finally,
ϕ1 W1 = C ln W1 + const
ϕ2 W2 = C ln W2 + const
ϕ W = C ln W + const

The quantity C is therefore a universal constant; it follows
from the kinetic theory of gases that its value is R/N , where
the meaning of the constants R and N is the same as above
If S0 denotes the entropy of a certain initial state and W is
the relative probability of a state of entropy S, we obtain in
general:
S − S0 = R ln W 
N

We now treat the following special case Let a volume v0
contain a number n of moving points (eg, molecules) to
188

PRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF LIGHT

which our discussion will apply The volume may also contain any arbitrary number of other moving points of any
kind No assumption is made about the law governing the
motion of the points under discussion in the volume except
that, as concerns this motion, no part of the space (and no
direction within it) is preferred over the others Further, let
the number of (aforementioned) moving points under discussion be small enough that we can disregard interactions
between them
This system, which, for example, can be an ideal gas or a
dilute solution, possesses a certain entropy S0  Let us imagine that all n moving points are assembled in a part of the
volume v0 of size v without any other changes in the system
It is obvious that this state has a different value of entropy
S , and we now wish to determine the difference in entropy
with the help of Boltzmann’s principle
We ask: How great is the probability of the last-mentioned
state relative to the original one? Or: How great is the probability that at a randomly chosen instant of time, all n independently moving points in a given volume v0 will be found
(by chance) in the volume v?
Obviously, this probability, which is a “statistical probability,” has the value

from this, by applying Boltzmann’s principle, one obtains

It is noteworthy that, in the derivation of this equation,
from which the Boyle–Gay-Lussac law and the analogous

law governing the motion of the molecules
6 Interpretation According to Boltzmann’s

From this we further conclude that monochromatic radiation of low density (within the range of validity of Wien’s

We also want to compare the mean value of the energy

If monochromatic radiation (of sufficiently low density)
behaves, as concerns the dependence of its entropy on volume, as though the radiation were a discontinuous medium
consisting of energy quanta of magnitude Rβν/N , then it
seems reasonable to investigate whether the laws governing
the emission and transformation of light are also constructed
as if light consisted of such energy quanta We will consider
this question in the following sections
191

PAPER 5

7 On Stokes’s Rule
Let monochromatic light be transformed by photoluminescence into light of a different frequency, and, in accordance
with the result just obtained, let us assume that both the
incident and emitted light consist of energy quanta of magnitude R/N βν, where ν denotes the relevant frequency The
transformation process can then be interpreted as follows
Each incident energy quantum of frequency ν1 is absorbed
and—at least at a sufficiently low distribution density of the
incident energy quanta—generates by itself a light quantum
of frequency ν2 ; it is possible that the absorption of the
incident light quantum may simultaneously give rise to
the emission of light quanta of frequencies ν3  ν4 , etc, as
well as to energy of some other kind (eg, heat) It makes no
difference by means of what intermediary processes this
end result occurs If the photoluminescent substance is not
regarded as a permanent energy source, then, according to
the principle of conservation of energy, the energy of an
emitted energy quantum cannot be greater than that of the
light quantum that produced it; hence it follows that
R βν  R βν 
1
N 2
N

or
ν2  ν1 

This is the well-known Stokes’s rule
It is to be emphasized that, according to our conception,
at low illumination the amount of light emitted must be
proportional to the intensity of the incident light, because
each incident energy quantum will induce an elementary
process of the kind indicated above, independently of other
192

PRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF LIGHT

incident energy quanta In particular, there will be no lower
limit for the intensity of the incident light, below which the
light would be unable to excite the fluorescent effect
According to the conception of the phenomenon presented here, deviations from Stokes’s rule are conceivable
in the following cases:
1 If the number of energy quanta per unit volume simultaneously being transformed is so large that an energy quantum
of emitted light can obtain its energy from several incident
energy quanta
2 When the incident (or emitted) light does not have the same
energy distribution as black-body radiation within the range
of validity of Wien’s law; if, for example, the incident light
is produced by a body of such high temperature that Wien’s
law is no longer valid for the relevant wavelengths

The latter possibility deserves special attention According
to the conception developed above, it is indeed not impossible that even at very low densities a “non-Wien radiation”
will behave differently as concerns its energy from blackbody radiation within the range of validity of Wien’s law
8 On the Generation of Cathode Rays by
Illumination of Solid Bodies
The usual view that the energy of light is continuously
distributed over the space through which it travels faces
especially great difficulties when one attempts to explain
photoelectric phenomena, which are expounded in a pioneering work by Mr Lenard7
7

P Lenard, Ann d Phys 8 (1902): 169, 170
193

PAPER 5

According to the view that the incident light consists of
energy quanta of energy R/N βν, the production of cathode rays by light can be conceived in the following way The
body’s surface layer is penetrated by energy quanta whose
energy is converted at least partially into kinetic energy of
the electrons The simplest conception is that a light quantum transfers its entire energy to a single electron; we will
assume that this can occur However, we will not exclude the
possibility that electrons absorb only a part of the energy of
the light quanta
An electron in the interior of the body having kinetic energy will have lost part of its kinetic energy by the time
it reaches the surface In addition, we will assume that, in
leaving the body, each electron must perform some work, P
(characteristic for the body) The electrons leaving the body
with the greatest perpendicular velocity will be those located
right on the surface and ejected normally to it The kinetic
energy of such electrons is
R βν − P 
N

If the body is charged to a positive potential  and surrounded by conductors at zero potential, and if  is just
sufficient to prevent a loss of electrical charge by the body,
it follows that
ǫ = R βν − P 
N

where ǫ denotes the charge of the electron; or
E = Rβν − P ′ 
194

PRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMATION OF LIGHT

where E is the charge of one gram-equivalent of a monovalent ion and P ′ is the potential of this quantity of negative
charge relative to the body8
If one sets E = 96 × 103 , then  · 10−8 is the potential in
volts that the body acquires when irradiated in vacuum
To see whether the derived relation agrees in order of
magnitude with experiment, set P ′ = 0, ν = 103 × 1015
(which corresponds to the ultraviolet limit of the solar spectrum) and β = 4866 × 10−11  We obtain  · 107 = 43 volts,
a result that agrees in order of magnitude with the results
of Mr Lenard9
If the formula derived is correct, then , when plotted
in Cartesian coordinates as a function of the frequency of
the incident light, must give a straight line whose slope is
independent of the nature of the substance under study
As far as I can tell, this conception of the photoelectric effect does contradict its properties as observed by Mr
Lenard If each energy quantum of the incident light transmits its energy to electrons, independently of all others, then
the velocity distribution of the electrons, ie, the nature of
cathode rays produced, will be independent of the intensity
of the incident light; on the other hand, under otherwise
identical circumstances, the number of electrons leaving the
body will be proportional to the intensity of the incident
light10

If one assumes that the individual electron can only be detached by
light from a neutral molecule by the expenditure of some work, one does
not have to change anything in the relation just derived; one need only
consider P ′ as the sum of two terms

Remarks similar to those regarding possible deviations
from Stokes’s rule apply to the possible limits of validity of
the laws set forth above
In the foregoing it has been assumed that at least some
of the quanta of the incident light transmit their energies
completely to one electron each If this likely assumption is
not made, one obtains the following equation in place of the
last one:
E + P ′  Rβν
For cathode luminescence, which is the inverse of the
process discussed above, one obtains by analogous considerations:
E + P ′  R βν
For the substances investigated by Mr Lenard, P E8 is always considerably greater than Rβν because the potential
difference, which the cathode rays must traverse in order to
produce visible light, amounts in some cases to hundreds,
in others to thousands of volts11 We must therefore assume
that the kinetic energy of one electron goes into the production of many energy quanta of light
9 On the Ionization of Gases by
Ultraviolet Light
We have to assume that, in ionization of a gas by ultraviolet light, one energy quantum of light serves to ionize one
gas molecule From this it follows that the ionization energy
(ie, the work theoretically required for its ionization) of a

molecule cannot be greater than the energy of an absorbed
light quantum capable of producing this effect If J denotes
the (theoretical) ionization energy per gram-equivalent, it
follows that
Rβν  J 

According to Lenard’s measurements, the largest effective
wavelength for air is about 19 × 10−5 cm, hence
Rβν = 64 × 1012 erg  J 

An upper limit for the ionization energy can also be obtained from the ionization potentials of rarefied gases According to J Stark12 the smallest measured ionization potential (for platinum anodes) for air is about 10 volts13 Thus,
one obtains 96 × 1012 as the upper limit for J , which is almost equal to the value found above There is still another
consequence, verification of which by experiment seems to
me of great importance If each absorbed energy quantum
of light ionizes one molecule, then the following relation
must hold between the quantity of light absorbed L and the
number j of gram-molecules of ionized gas:
j= L 
Rβν

If our conception is correct, this relation must be valid for all
gases that (at the relevant frequency) show no appreciable
absorption unaccompanied by ionization

In the interior of the gases, however, the ionization potential of negative ions is five times greater
